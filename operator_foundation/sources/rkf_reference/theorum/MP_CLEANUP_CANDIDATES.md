# MP cleanup candidates after theorum transfer

The theorem capsules have been moved into `Parveen117/Recognition-Kernel-Framework/theorum` on branch `agent/transfer-certified-theorum-from-mp`.

This file records what should be removed from MP next. It is intentionally a candidate list because the source material lives across several open MP branches, not one merged directory.

## Safe deletion class

Delete from MP only after confirming the corresponding theorem capsule exists in RKF:

```text
human-readable theorem summaries;
status JSON files whose content is duplicated in RKF provenance;
old manuscript theorem surfaces superseded by the RKF theorum capsules.
```

## Do not delete without archival copy

```text
native verifier scripts;
test modules;
state capsules;
raw numerical ledgers;
source audit scripts;
large artifacts needed to regenerate the theorem packets.
```

## Candidate MP PRs and files

### PR #246, branch `agent/rh-rotation-metric-topology-reset`

Candidate readable/status surfaces:

```text
proof_lab/clock_free_recognition/NATIVE_EXACT_ETA_FAMILY_PATH_INDEPENDENCE.md
proof_lab/clock_free_recognition/EXACT_ETA_FAMILY_PATH_INDEPENDENCE_STATUS.json
proof_lab/clock_free_recognition/NATIVE_ACTUAL_ETA_NORMALIZATION_TWO_PATH_ANALYTICITY.md
proof_lab/clock_free_recognition/ACTUAL_ETA_NORMALIZATION_TWO_PATH_STATUS.json
proof_lab/clock_free_recognition/NATIVE_UGD_FIXED_FIVE_MULTIPLICATIVE_HOLONOMY.md
proof_lab/clock_free_recognition/UGD_FIXED_FIVE_MULTIPLICATIVE_HOLONOMY_STATUS.json
```

Keep scripts/tests unless deliberately archiving them:

```text
native_state_locked_exact_eta_family_path_independence.py
test_native_state_locked_exact_eta_family_path_independence.py
native_state_locked_ugd_eta_normalization_rectangle.py
test_native_state_locked_ugd_eta_normalization_rectangle.py
```

### PR #200 stack

Candidate readable theorem surfaces are spread through the M3 stack PRs #181-#200. Keep all executable ledgers until exact file-level archive exists.

### PR #242/#247/#254/#255/#277

Candidate deletion class:

```text
manuscript theorem summaries duplicated by RKF theorum;
status files that merely restate seam-integer / T03 conclusions.
```

Keep source-audit and build files unless the publication bundle is separately archived.

## Cleanup rule

Use one MP cleanup branch per source PR branch. Do not delete across unrelated open branches in one blind operation. Future humans already have enough ruins to interpret.
