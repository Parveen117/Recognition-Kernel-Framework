# Cut-Memory Spectral Isomorphism and Rank-Five Fredholm Reduction

## Status

This theorem formalizes the actual infinite-to-finite mechanism behind the Recognition Kernel Framework.

It corrects three tempting but false shortcuts:

```text
det(I-B) > 0 is not sufficient for positivity when rank(B) >= 2;
centrality of a projection does not imply rank five;
the ordinary spectral gap is not generally equal to lambda_min(I-B)
unless the operator is measured in the positive reference metric.
```

The correct capstone is a **relative** spectral theorem.

## 1. Native cut setup

Let \(\mathcal H\) be a Hilbert carrier with a fixed orthogonal cut decomposition

\[
\mathcal H=P\mathcal H\oplus Q\mathcal H,
\qquad
P+Q=I,
\qquad
PQ=QP=0.
\]

Let \(\pi\) be the represented event algebra and let

\[
V_0:\mathcal H_{\rm rec}\longrightarrow P\mathcal H
\]

be the recognized inclusion.

For an admissible event \(a\), define the cut bridge

\[
\boxed{
C_a=Q\pi(a)V_0:
\mathcal H_{\rm rec}\longrightarrow Q\mathcal H.
}
\]

The cut projection is canonical, but it is not assumed to be central in the
operator-algebraic sense.  Indeed, if \(Q\) commuted with every \(\pi(a)\) and
\(QV_0=0\), then \(Q\pi(a)V_0=0\), killing the bridge.  The relevant object is
the off-diagonal cut corner \(Q\pi(a)P\).

The framework-specific rank theorem is the following input.

### Memory Cut Rank Hypothesis

The target-relevant cut-memory space

\[
\mathcal E_\Sigma
=
\overline{\operatorname{Ran} C_a}
\]

has finite dimension

\[
\nu_\Sigma\le 5.
\]

The theorem below proves exactly what follows once this rank statement and the
positive reference decomposition are available.

---

## 2. Positive spectrum is transport; zero spectrum is memory

### Theorem 2.1 (Cut-bridge spectral isomorphism)

Let \(C:\mathcal H_1\to\mathcal H_2\) be bounded. Then

\[
\sigma(C^*C)\setminus\{0\}
=
\sigma(CC^*)\setminus\{0\}
\]

with multiplicity.

If \(C=U|C|\) is the polar decomposition, then \(U\) is unitary from the
initial support \(\overline{\operatorname{Ran}|C|}\) onto the final support
\(\overline{\operatorname{Ran}C}\), and

\[
U(C^*C)U^*=CC^*
\]

on those supports.

The zero modes remain directional:

\[
\ker C
\quad\text{and}\quad
\ker C^*.
\]

If \(C\) is Fredholm, their difference is the cut-memory index

\[
\boxed{
\operatorname{ind}C
=
\dim\ker C-\dim\ker C^*.
}
\]

#### Proof

If \(C^*Cx=\lambda x\) with \(\lambda>0\), then \(Cx\neq0\) and

\[
CC^*(Cx)=C(C^*Cx)=\lambda Cx.
\]

The inverse correspondence is obtained by applying \(C^*\).  Multiplicity is
preserved.  The polar-decomposition statement is standard on the initial and
final support spaces.  The zero spaces are not transported by this positive
spectral correspondence and therefore retain the direction of the cut. ∎

### Corollary 2.2 (Cut-generated rotation memory)

On the direct sum of the initial and final supports, define

\[
\mathfrak i_C
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0&-U^*\\
U&0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{
\mathfrak i_C^2=-I
}
\]

on the support sum, and hence

\[
\boxed{
e^{\theta\mathfrak i_C}
=
\cos\theta\,I+\sin\theta\,\mathfrak i_C.
}
\]

Thus the Euler rotation is derived from the polar memory of the cut bridge.

---

## 3. The exact infinite-to-finite theorem

Let \(R=R^*\) be a positive reference operator satisfying

\[
R\ge mI
\qquad(m>0),
\]

and let

\[
V_\Sigma:\mathbb C^\nu\longrightarrow\mathcal H,
\qquad
\nu\le5,
\]

be the target-relevant cut-memory injection.

Define

\[
F=R-V_\Sigma V_\Sigma^*,
\]

\[
A=R^{-1/2}V_\Sigma,
\]

and the finite seam matrix

\[
\boxed{
B=V_\Sigma^*R^{-1}V_\Sigma=A^*A
\in M_\nu(\mathbb C).
}
\]

### Theorem 3.1 (Cut-memory Birman--Schwinger--Fredholm isomorphism)

The following identities hold.

#### Normalized factorization

\[
\boxed{
F
=
R^{1/2}(I-AA^*)R^{1/2}.
}
\]

#### Shared nonzero spectrum

\[
\boxed{
\sigma(AA^*)\setminus\{0\}
=
\sigma(B)\setminus\{0\}
}
\]

with multiplicity.

#### Exact inertia reduction

\[
\boxed{
N_-(F)=N_+(B-I).
}
\]

Moreover,

\[
\boxed{
\dim\ker F=\dim\ker(I-B).
}
\]

Hence

\[
\boxed{
F\ge0
\iff
B\le I.
}
\]

#### Exact relative gap

Define the reference-normalized gap

\[
\delta_R(F)
=
\inf_{x\ne0}
\frac{\langle x,Fx\rangle}
     {\langle x,Rx\rangle}.
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{
\delta_R(F)
=
\lambda_{\min}(I-B)
=
1-\lambda_{\max}(B).
}
\]

Therefore, if \(\delta_R(F)>0\),

\[
F\ge \delta_R(F)R
\ge m\,\delta_R(F)I.
\]

Thus the ordinary spectral gap has the certified lower bound

\[
\boxed{
\operatorname{dist}(0,\sigma(F))
\ge
m\,\lambda_{\min}(I-B).
}
\]

If \(R=I\), this becomes the exact absolute gap identity

\[
\operatorname{dist}(0,\sigma(F))
=
\lambda_{\min}(I-B)
\]

in the positive case.

#### Fredholm determinant isomorphism

Since \(AA^*\) has rank at most \(\nu\),

\[
\boxed{
\det_{\!F}(I-AA^*)
=
\det(I-B).
}
\]

The determinant vanishes exactly at a threshold memory:

\[
\det(I-B)=0
\iff
1\in\sigma(B)
\iff
\ker F\ne\{0\}.
\]

#### Proof

The factorization follows from

\[
R-V_\Sigma V_\Sigma^*
=
R^{1/2}
\left(
I-R^{-1/2}V_\Sigma V_\Sigma^*R^{-1/2}
\right)
R^{1/2}.
\]

The nonzero spectra of \(AA^*\) and \(A^*A=B\) coincide by Theorem 2.1.

The map \(x\mapsto R^{1/2}x\) is invertible, so the quadratic-form inertia of
\(F\) equals the inertia of \(I-AA^*\).  Its negative directions correspond
exactly to eigenvalues of \(AA^*\), hence of \(B\), larger than one.  Its zero
space corresponds exactly to the unit eigenspace of \(B\).

For the relative gap, set \(z=R^{1/2}x\).  Then

\[
\frac{\langle x,Fx\rangle}{\langle x,Rx\rangle}
=
\frac{\langle z,(I-AA^*)z\rangle}{\|z\|^2}.
\]

The smallest spectral value of \(I-AA^*\) is
\(1-\lambda_{\max}(AA^*)=1-\lambda_{\max}(B)\).

Finally, the finite-rank Sylvester identity gives

\[
\det_{\!F}(I-AA^*)
=
\det(I-A^*A)
=
\det(I-B).
\]

∎

---

## 4. The determinant warning

### Proposition 4.1

For \(\nu\ge2\),

\[
\det(I-B)>0
\]

does **not** imply \(B<I\) or \(F>0\).

#### Exact counterexample

Take

\[
B=\operatorname{diag}
\left(
4,\frac94,\frac14,\frac49,\frac9{16}
\right).
\]

Then

\[
\det(I-B)=\frac{175}{256}>0,
\]

but \(B\) has two eigenvalues above one, so

\[
N_-(F)=N_+(B-I)=2.
\]

The lawful terminal certificate is therefore

\[
\boxed{
\lambda_{\min}(I-B)>0,
}
\]

equivalently

\[
\boxed{
\lambda_{\max}(B)<1.
}
\]

The determinant isomorphism identifies threshold zeros and multiplicities, but
its sign alone is not the positivity test.

---

## 5. The actual infinite-to-finite animal

Under the Memory Cut Rank Hypothesis \(\nu_\Sigma\le5\), the infinite carrier
does not need to be diagonalized.

The exact terminal quantities are:

\[
\boxed{
\text{seam integer}
=
N_+(B-I)
=
N_-(F),
}
\]

\[
\boxed{
\text{relative spectral gap}
=
\lambda_{\min}(I-B),
}
\]

and

\[
\boxed{
\text{threshold multiplicity}
=
\dim\ker(I-B)
=
\dim\ker F.
}
\]

Thus the infinite sign, gap and threshold-memory problems reduce exactly to a
matrix of size at most five.

This is the correct mathematical version of the Copernican hierarchy:

```text
cut bridge
-> polar transport and zero memory
-> finite target-relevant memory range
-> positive reference minus finite cut defect
-> five-matrix seam operator
-> exact inertia, gap and determinant reduction.
```

---

## 6. RH specialization and the genuine next theorem

The theorem above is universal.  To apply it to the completed-Weil endpoint,
the framework must prove the following native identification.

### Targeted Theorem (Memory Cut Rank and Source-Defect Identification)

Construct \(R\) and \(V_\Sigma\) directly from the native completed-Weil cut
events so that

\[
\boxed{
W_3^-
=
R-V_\Sigma V_\Sigma^*,
}
\]

\[
\boxed{
\overline{\operatorname{Ran}V_\Sigma}
=
\overline{\operatorname{Ran}
\left(
Q\pi(\mathcal A_{\rm Weil})V_0
\right)},
}
\]

and

\[
\boxed{
\operatorname{rank}V_\Sigma\le5.
}
\]

Then the completed-Weil odd sign is equivalent to

\[
B\le I,
\]

and its reference-normalized gap is exactly

\[
\lambda_{\min}(I-B).
\]

This targeted theorem, not determinant sign by itself, is the native bridge
that can eliminate the infinite-dimensional barrier.

---

## 7. Numerical certificate v0.1

The executable packet checks four independent cases.

### Cut-bridge calibration

A \(5\times7\) cut bridge has:

```text
rank                              5
dim ker C                         2
dim ker C*                        0
index                             2
positive-spectrum residual        0
iota-square residual              0
```

### Exact subcritical five-memory packet

\[
\sigma(B)
=
\left\{
\frac14,\frac49,\frac9{16},\frac{16}{25},\frac{81}{100}
\right\}.
\]

Then

\[
\lambda_{\min}(I-B)=\frac{19}{100},
\]

and

\[
\det(I-B)=\frac{399}{32000}.
\]

The full normalized operator and the five-matrix produce the same gap, inertia,
kernel dimension and determinant.

### Threshold packet

Replacing \(81/100\) by \(1\) gives:

```text
full kernel dimension            1
five-matrix kernel dimension     1
determinant                      0
```

### Positive-determinant negative control

The exact packet

\[
B=\operatorname{diag}
\left(
4,\frac94,\frac14,\frac49,\frac9{16}
\right)
\]

has

\[
\det(I-B)=\frac{175}{256}>0
\]

but seam integer and full negative index both equal two.

This permanently rejects the false determinant-sign shortcut.

The frozen executable status is

```text
PASS_CUT_MEMORY_SPECTRAL_ISOMORPHISM_V0_1
```

with fourteen fail-closed checks.
