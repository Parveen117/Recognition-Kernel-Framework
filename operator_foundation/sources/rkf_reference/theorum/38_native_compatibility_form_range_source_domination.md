# Native Compatibility Form-Range and T21 Cut-Source Domination Theorem

## 1. Purpose

Stage 3E attached the physical completion boundary to the native two-sheet
Hardy chart.  It then asked whether the boundary density belongs to the
ordinary operator range of the compatibility defect.

That range condition is stronger than the endpoint sign requires and, in
infinite dimension, its stated kernel equivalence needs a closed-range
hypothesis.  The correct native object is the inverse-half **form range** of the
completed physical source.

This stage makes that correction and attaches the direct T21 cut ledger to the
actual prime--Gamma--debt source.  The native order is

```text
prime and Gamma mismatch events
-> exact diagonal debt
-> completed two-sheet source symbol A_0
-> cumulative cut lower branch s_T21
-> physical boundary recognition class
-> inverse-half form-range decoder
-> strict decoder reserve
-> completed-Weil cut covariance.
```

No source inverse vector, attained threshold state, fitted event rotation or
positive-shift extrapolation is consumed.

## 2. Correction of the Stage 3E ambient-range gate

Let \(C\) be a bounded operator.  In general,

\[
b\perp\ker C
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
b\in\overline{\operatorname{Ran}C^*}.
\]

The stronger statement

\[
b\perp\ker C
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
b\in\operatorname{Ran}C^*
\]

holds when \(\operatorname{Ran}C\) is closed.  Thus the finite exact
calibrations in Stage 3E remain correct, but ordinary compatibility-defect
range membership is not the universal infinite-dimensional terminal gate.

For the completed source the correct condition is

\[
\boxed{
b_\partial\in
\operatorname{Dom}\!\left(S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}\,\dagger/2}\right).
}
\tag{2.1}
\]

This is an inverse-half form-domain statement.  It permits nonattained
criticality: a completed decoder may exist even when the formal source inverse
vector does not belong to the Hilbert carrier.

---

## 3. Abstract form-range decoder theorem

Let

\[
T:\mathcal H\longrightarrow\mathcal Y
\]

be a bounded analysis and put

\[
S=T^*T\ge0.
\]

Let \(b\in\mathcal H\), and define

\[
L_b(f)=\langle b,f\rangle.
\]

### Theorem 3.1 (Inverse-half form-range transfer)

The following are equivalent:

1. \(L_b\) is bounded for the source seminorm \(f\mapsto\|Tf\|\);
2. \(b\in\operatorname{Dom}(S^{\dagger/2})\);
3. there exists a unique minimum-norm decoder
   \[
   c_b\in\overline{\operatorname{Ran}T}
   \]
   satisfying
   \[
   L_b(f)=\langle c_b,Tf\rangle.
   \]

Moreover,

\[
\boxed{
c_b=J_S S^{\dagger/2}b,
}
\tag{3.1}
\]

where

\[
J_S=T S^{\dagger/2}
\]

is the canonical source isometry on the positive support, and

\[
\boxed{
\|c_b\|^2
=
\|S^{\dagger/2}b\|^2
=
\sup_{Tf\ne0}
\frac{|L_b(f)|^2}{\|Tf\|^2}.
}
\tag{3.2}
\]

#### Proof

On \((\ker S)^\perp\),

\[
T=J_S S^{1/2}.
\]

If \(u=S^{\dagger/2}b\), then

\[
L_b(f)
=
\langle u,S^{1/2}f\rangle
=
\langle J_Su,Tf\rangle.
\]

Thus \(c_b=J_Su\) is a decoder and has norm \(\|u\|\).  Conversely, if
\(L_b(f)=\langle c,Tf\rangle\), then

\[
b=T^*c=S^{1/2}J_S^*c,
\]

so \(b\in\operatorname{Ran}S^{1/2}
=\operatorname{Dom}(S^{\dagger/2})\).  Orthogonal projection of \(c\) onto
\(\overline{\operatorname{Ran}T}\) gives the unique minimum-norm decoder.
Equation (3.2) is the norm of the induced functional on
\(\overline{\operatorname{Ran}T}\). ∎

### Corollary 3.2 (Cut covariance)

If

\[
\beta_b:=\|S^{\dagger/2}b\|^2<1,
\]

then

\[
\boxed{
S-bb^*
\ge
(1-\beta_b)S
\ge0.
}
\tag{3.3}
\]

No vector solving \(Sh=b\) is required.

## 4. Exact completed two-sheet source symbol

Put

\[
m_{\mathrm p}
=
\sum_{n\ge2}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^2},
\qquad
q(\xi)
=
\sum_{n\ge2}
\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^2}e^{i\xi\log n},
\]

and

\[
\mathcal Q(\xi)
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0&q(\xi)\\
\overline{q(\xi)}&0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

Let

\[
g_0(\xi)=G(\xi)+m_\Gamma.
\]

The prime and Gamma mismatch factorizations give the completed physical source
symbol after the exact diagonal debt is paid:

\[
\boxed{
A_0(\xi)
=
\bigl(g_0(\xi)+m_{\mathrm p}\bigr)I_2
-
\mathcal Q(\xi).
}
\tag{4.1}
\]

Its eigenvalue branches are

\[
s_\pm(\xi)
=
g_0(\xi)+m_{\mathrm p}\pm|q(\xi)|,
\]

so the lower branch is

\[
\boxed{
s_0(\xi)
=
g_0(\xi)+m_{\mathrm p}-|q(\xi)|.
}
\tag{4.2}
\]

Since

\[
g_0(0)=0,
\qquad
q(0)=m_{\mathrm p},
\]

one has

\[
s_0(0)=0.
\]

The compatibility defect is a factorization of this same source.  It is not a
second physical source requiring a separate terminal range theorem.

---

## 5. T21 as a Loewner lower chart

The covariant phase removal gives, for \(\xi>0\),

\[
s_0'(\xi)
=
G'(\xi)-(|q|)'(\xi).
\]

The directed T21 packet supplies:

```text
near-zero covariant slope-gap lower       28.96922744937062
minimum positive source floor             0.0003621153431171327
terminal active source floor              5.206639333818032
source floor on [12,13]                    0.4571260170709391
far-ray source floor                       0.1568358628972386
active cells                               2400
prime-power events                         78734
```

Near the first cut,

\[
s_0'(\xi)\ge\gamma_0\xi
\]

and therefore

\[
\boxed{
s_0(\xi)\ge\frac{\gamma_0}{2}\xi^2.
}
\tag{5.1}
\]

On every remaining active cell, the directed derivative-gap lower is integrated
from the preceding certified node.  Hence the stored cumulative floor
\(s_j^-\) satisfies

\[
s_0(\xi)\ge s_j^-
\qquad(\xi\in I_j).
\]

On the outside region the direct lower-branch certificates apply.  Therefore,
with \(s_{\mathrm{T21}}\) denoting the piecewise directed floor,

\[
\boxed{
A_0(\xi)\ge s_{\mathrm{T21}}(\xi)I_2
}
\tag{5.2}
\]

on the complete two-sheet chart.

This is the missing Loewner attachment.  The profile is not an unrelated
derivative table: it is obtained by integrating the lower-branch derivative
from the exact seam value \(s_0(0)=0\).

---

## 6. Boundary recognition class in the same chart

Stage 3E gives the exact Cauchy representative

\[
L_\partial(f)
=
\langle b_{\partial,\mathrm{Cauchy}},
J_{\mathrm{2sh}}f\rangle.
\]

The native metric graph gives the Riesz state

\[
r_\partial=M_X^{-1}q_b
\]

and the weighted boundary object

\[
w_\partial(x)=e^{-3|x|/2}r_\partial(x).
\]

Its two-sheet/Fourier representative
\(b_{\partial,\mathrm{T21}}\) generates the same physical functional.  Hence

\[
\boxed{
J_{\mathrm{2sh}}^*
\bigl(
b_{\partial,\mathrm{Cauchy}}
-
b_{\partial,\mathrm{T21}}
\bigr)
=0.
}
\tag{6.1}
\]

The two representatives belong to the same Recognition-Seam boundary class.
The burden depends on that physical class, while any nonminimal representative
gives a lawful outward bound.

The source manuscript proves

\[
\int |w_\partial(x)|\,dx
\le\frac{1}{3\sqrt2},
\]

and the sharper first moment

\[
\int |x|\,|w_\partial(x)|\,dx
\le\frac19.
\]

The direct T21 packet deliberately uses the older coarse value \(1/3\), so its
result remains outward.

---

## 7. Cellwise form-domain theorem

Let \(A(x)\ge s(x)I\), with \(s(x)>0\) away from a declared seam, and let
\(b(x)\) be the actual boundary representative in that chart.  If

\[
\beta_{\mathrm{env}}
=
\int\frac{\|b(x)\|^2}{s(x)}\,d\mu(x)
<\infty,
\]

then

\[
b\in\operatorname{Dom}(A^{\dagger/2})
\]

and

\[
\boxed{
\|A^{\dagger/2}b\|^2
\le
\beta_{\mathrm{env}}.
}
\tag{7.1}
\]

At a quadratic first cut,

\[
s(\xi)\ge c\xi^2,
\qquad
\|b(\xi)\|\le M_1|\xi|,
\]

the quotient remains finite:

\[
\boxed{
\int_{-h}^{h}
\frac{\|b(\xi)\|^2}{s(\xi)}\,d\xi
\le
\frac{2hM_1^2}{c}.
}
\tag{7.2}
\]

Thus the zero cut does not require an operator-range vector.  Linear boundary
memory cancels the quadratic source opening in the inverse-half form domain.

---

## 8. Actual direct-unshifted attachment

The imported direct packet gives

\[
\beta_{\mathrm{first}}
\le
0.00007670975092815261,
\]

\[
\beta_{\mathrm{active}}
\le
0.2976678523563374,
\]

and

\[
\beta_{\mathrm{outside}}
\le
0.5313410580584792.
\]

Their exact displayed sum is

\[
0.82908562016574475261,
\]

and the stored outward value is

\[
\boxed{
\beta_\partial^{\mathrm{cut}}
\le
0.8290856201657449
<1.
}
\tag{8.1}
\]

By Theorem 3.1, the actual minimum decoder

\[
c_\partial
\in
\overline{\operatorname{Ran}\Xi_0}
\]

exists and satisfies

\[
L_\partial(f)
=
\langle c_\partial,\Xi_0f\rangle,
\]

\[
\|c_\partial\|^2
\le
0.8290856201657449.
\]

Therefore

\[
\boxed{
S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}
-
L_\partial^*L_\partial
\ge
0.1709143798342551\,
S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}
\ge0.
}
\tag{8.2}
\]

Equivalently, after the unit-boundary-state enlargement of Stage 3A,

\[
\boxed{
S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}
-
L_\partial^*L_\partial
=
\widehat\Xi_0^*
\bigl(I-p_\partial p_\partial^*\bigr)
\widehat\Xi_0.
}
\tag{8.3}
\]

This closes the actual decoder bound and the completed-Weil odd cut covariance.
It does not yet assert strict positivity on every nonzero odd state; that
requires source-kernel injectivity on this same completed carrier.

---

## 9. Exact executable calibrations

The Stage 3F packet verifies:

```text
nonattained form-range model:
  completed decoder burden                  1/4
  formal source-inverse prefix energy       4N/25 -> infinity

two-sheet Loewner model:
  every lower source floor                  1
  total boundary burden                     419/7200

recognition-class model:
  distinct ambient boundary representatives
  identical physical boundary row
  minimum class burden                      2/3

cellwise cut model:
  first cut                                 1/40
  active cells                              21/400
  outside                                   1/40
  total burden                              41/400
```

The actual Decimal audit reproduces the T21 component sum, outward upper and
relative reserve.

---

## 10. Next theorem

The remaining native odd theorem is

\[
\boxed{
\ker S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}=\{0\}
}
\]

on the same Stage 3F carrier.

The Hardy active-band no-blindness theorem already supplies the analytic
mechanism.  Stage 3G must attach it explicitly to \(\Xi_0\), then verify the
odd classical explicit-formula normalization interface without reintroducing
the even-sector or T03 routes.
