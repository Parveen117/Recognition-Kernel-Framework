# Bilateral Jet-Flow Recognition Capstone Theorem

## 1. Status and purpose

This theorem joins the certified cut-graded generator theorem with the typed
lambda-Jacobian tower. Its purpose is to provide one lawful interface for a
later physical adapter:

```text
cut-graded generator
-> bilateral Euler/recognition flow
-> finite response jets
-> explicit remainder
-> nested recognition kernels
-> target burden
-> seam-curvature response
-> fail-closed classification.
```

The exact rational packet in
`proof_lab/bilateral_jet_flow_capstone.py` verifies a finite nilpotent model and
pins the candidate certificate hash. The theorem below is an abstract bounded-
operator statement. Unbounded generators require the domain conditions stated
in Section 10.

The term *bilateral strands* is used deliberately. A physical double-helical
interpretation requires a separate adapter and is not smuggled in by drawing
two arrows around a circle, humanity's traditional method of discovering
unearned geometry.

## 2. Native data

Let \(\mathcal H\) and \(\mathcal Y\) be Hilbert spaces. Let

\[
J=J^*=J^{-1}
\]

be the primitive cut on \(\mathcal H\). Let \(G\) be a bounded generator and

\[
U_t=e^{tG}.
\]

Let

\[
B:\mathcal H\to\mathcal Y
\]

be a bounded observer. For the principal bilateral theorem assume

\[
JGJ=-G,
\qquad BJ=B.
\tag{2.1}
\]

The first condition says that the generator transports across the cut. The
second says that the declared observer reads the cut-even output channel.

Define the order-\(k\) observer jet

\[
\boxed{\Lambda_k:=BG^k,\qquad k\ge0.}
\tag{2.2}
\]

and the finite jet observer

\[
\boxed{
\mathcal A_Nx
=(\Lambda_0x,\Lambda_1x,\ldots,\Lambda_Nx).
}
\tag{2.3}
\]

For a scalar target \(L\), define the order-\(N\) burden

\[
\boxed{
\beta_N(L)
=
\sup_{\mathcal A_Nx\ne0}
\frac{|Lx|^2}{\|\mathcal A_Nx\|^2}.
}
\tag{2.4}
\]

---

## 3. Bilateral flow and strand closure

### Theorem 3.1 (Bilateral cut conjugacy)

Under (2.1),

\[
\boxed{JU_tJ=U_{-t}.}
\tag{3.1}
\]

Define the state channels

\[
\widehat J_t=U_t+U_{-t},
\qquad
\widehat C_t=U_t-U_{-t}.
\tag{3.2}
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{\widehat J_t^2-\widehat C_t^2=4I,}
\tag{3.3}
\]

and

\[
\boxed{\widehat J_t\widehat C_t=\widehat C_t\widehat J_t.}
\tag{3.4}
\]

The forward and backward observer strands are

\[
S_+(t)=BU_t,
\qquad
S_-(t)=BU_{-t}.
\tag{3.5}
\]

Their cut-conjugacy defect is

\[
\Delta_H(t)=BJU_tJ-BU_{-t}.
\tag{3.6}
\]

Therefore

\[
\boxed{\Delta_H(t)=0.}
\tag{3.7}
\]

#### Proof

Functional calculus applied to \(JGJ=-G\) gives (3.1). Since \(U_tU_{-t}=I\)
and both flows are functions of \(G\), the square and commutation identities
follow. Equation (3.7) follows from \(BJ=B\). \(\square\)

A nonzero \(\Delta_H\) is not a decorative error bar. It means that at least
one of the declared cut, generator, observer or domain covariance conditions
has failed.

---

## 4. Alternating cut parity of the jet tower

### Theorem 4.1 (Jet parity ladder)

For every \(k\ge0\),

\[
\boxed{\Lambda_kJ=(-1)^k\Lambda_k.}
\tag{4.1}
\]

Thus even jet levels are cut even and odd jet levels are cut odd.

#### Proof

From \(JGJ=-G\) one obtains \(GJ=-JG\), hence

\[
G^kJ=(-1)^kJG^k.
\]

Multiplying by \(B\) and using \(BJ=B\) proves (4.1). \(\square\)

This is the precise bridge between the generator grading and the recursive
response tower. Parity is inherited at every order rather than assigned after
seeing a convenient pattern.

---

## 5. Finite jet reconstruction and remainder

### Theorem 5.1 (Observed-flow jet formula)

For every integer \(N\ge0\) and \(t\ge0\),

\[
\boxed{
BU_t
=
\sum_{k=0}^{N}\frac{t^k}{k!}\Lambda_k
+R_{N+1}(t),
}
\tag{5.1}
\]

where

\[
\boxed{
R_{N+1}(t)
=
\frac1{N!}
\int_0^t(t-s)^NBG^{N+1}U_s\,ds.
}
\tag{5.2}
\]

Consequently,

\[
\boxed{
\|R_{N+1}(t)\|
\le
\frac{t^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}
\|B\|\,\|G\|^{N+1}e^{t\|G\|}.
}
\tag{5.3}
\]

If \(G^{d+1}=0\), then

\[
\boxed{R_{d+1}(t)=0}
\tag{5.4}
\]

and the order-\(d\) jet reconstructs the observed flow exactly.

#### Proof

Apply the integral remainder formula for the bounded exponential series and
left-compose with \(B\). Nilpotent termination gives (5.4). \(\square\)

Equation (5.2) is the repository's exact native series/remainder interface. It
can later consume a separately proved Madhava calculus, but the present
repository contains no Madhava-named operator or certificate, so that name is
not claimed here.

---

## 6. Bilateral even and odd response strands

Define

\[
S_{\mathrm e}(t)
=\frac12(S_+(t)+S_-(t)),
\qquad
S_{\mathrm o}(t)
=\frac12(S_+(t)-S_-(t)).
\tag{6.1}
\]

### Theorem 6.1 (Bilateral strand reconstruction)

Whenever the exponential series converges,

\[
\boxed{
S_{\mathrm e}(t)
=
\sum_{m\ge0}\frac{t^{2m}}{(2m)!}\Lambda_{2m},
}
\tag{6.2}
\]

\[
\boxed{
S_{\mathrm o}(t)
=
\sum_{m\ge0}\frac{t^{2m+1}}{(2m+1)!}\Lambda_{2m+1}.
}
\tag{6.3}
\]

Moreover,

\[
\boxed{S_+=S_{\mathrm e}+S_{\mathrm o},
\qquad
S_-=S_{\mathrm e}-S_{\mathrm o}.}
\tag{6.4}
\]

#### Proof

Add and subtract the power series for \(BU_t\) and \(BU_{-t}\). \(\square\)

These are the abstract two strands available for a later helical adapter. A
physical braid, phase angle or twist memory must be defined from physical data
and proved to intertwine these strands.

---

## 7. Recognition kernels and first repair order

Let

\[
K_N=\ker\mathcal A_N.
\]

### Theorem 7.1 (Monotone blindness reduction)

For every \(N\),

\[
\boxed{K_{N+1}\subseteq K_N.}
\tag{7.1}
\]

For a target \(L\), define its first recognition order by

\[
\boxed{
\nu(L)
=
\inf\{N:\ K_N\subseteq\ker L\}.
}
\tag{7.2}
\]

If \(\nu(L)=r<\infty\), then the target is blind through order \(r-1\) and is
repaired at order \(r\).

#### Proof

\(\mathcal A_{N+1}\) contains every component of \(\mathcal A_N\) plus one
additional jet layer, so its common kernel can only shrink. Equation (7.2) is
therefore well defined whenever some finite tower recognizes the target.
\(\square\)

The theorem does not say that every additional layer is useful. It says that a
new layer cannot restore a direction already excluded by the earlier observer.
Strict repair must be demonstrated target by target.

---

## 8. Decoder burden and admissibility

Whenever \(\beta_N(L)\) is finite, the Recognition-Kernel theorem supplies a
minimum decoder \(c_{L,N}\) satisfying

\[
Lx=\langle\mathcal A_Nx,c_{L,N}\rangle,
\qquad
\|c_{L,N}\|^2=\beta_N(L).
\tag{8.1}
\]

The exact admissibility criterion is

\[
\boxed{
\mathcal A_N^*\mathcal A_N-L^*L\ge0
\iff
\beta_N(L)\le1.
}
\tag{8.2}
\]

Thus higher-order recognition and low decoder burden are separate obligations:
a target may become visible yet remain too expensive to certify at unit
reserve.

---

## 9. Seam curvature consumed by the jet observer

Now allow a general bounded generator

\[
G=G_{\mathrm e}+G_{\mathrm o},
\qquad
JG_{\mathrm e}J=G_{\mathrm e},
\qquad
JG_{\mathrm o}J=-G_{\mathrm o}.
\tag{9.1}
\]

Define the cut loop

\[
\mathscr H_J(t)=Je^{tG}Je^{tG}.
\tag{9.2}
\]

The universal-generator theorem gives

\[
\log\mathscr H_J(t)
=
2tG_{\mathrm e}
+t^2[G_{\mathrm e},G_{\mathrm o}]
+O(t^3).
\tag{9.3}
\]

Therefore the observed quadratic seam coefficient is

\[
\boxed{
[t^2]B\log\mathscr H_J(t)
=B[G_{\mathrm e},G_{\mathrm o}].
}
\tag{9.4}
\]

Equation (9.4) is the exact abstract curvature adapter. A physical model must
still prove what its measured response packet \(B\) is and why the right-hand
side represents the intended physical curvature.

---

## 10. Capstone classification

For one declared target and tower depth, assign:

```text
OPEN_SEAM
    if the bilateral closure defect is nonzero;

ABSTAIN
    if the target remains blind or no finite decoder exists;

BURDEN_EXCEEDS_ONE
    if the target is visible but beta_N(L) > 1;

HIGHER_LAYER_REPAIR
    if the target was blind at a lower layer, becomes visible at N,
    and beta_N(L) <= 1;

CLOSED
    if the target is already visible, the closure defect vanishes,
    and beta_N(L) <= 1.
```

This classification is fail-closed: algebraic inconsistency is checked before
predictive ambition.

---

## 11. Exact rational certificate

The finite certificate uses

\[
J=\operatorname{diag}(1,-1,1,-1),
\]

\[
G=
\begin{pmatrix}
0&1&0&0\\
0&0&1&0\\
0&0&0&1\\
0&0&0&0
\end{pmatrix},
\qquad G^4=0,
\]

and

\[
B=(1,0,0,0).
\]

Then

\[
BG^0=e_1^*,\quad BG=e_2^*,\quad BG^2=e_3^*,\quad BG^3=e_4^*,
\]

so the jet observers have ranks

\[
1,2,3,4
\]

and kernel dimensions

\[
3,2,1,0.
\]

The target

\[
L=\frac12e_4^*
\]

is blind through second order and repaired at third order. Since the full jet
observer is the identity,

\[
\beta_3(L)=\frac14,
\qquad
1-\beta_3(L)=\frac34.
\]

The certificate also uses a wrong-cut negative control and verifies that its
bilateral closure defect is nonzero.
