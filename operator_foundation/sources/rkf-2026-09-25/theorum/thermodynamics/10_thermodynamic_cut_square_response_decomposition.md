# Thermodynamic Cut-Square Response Decomposition Theorem

## 1. Purpose

This capsule specializes the native cut-square and minimum-decoder theorems to the positive thermodynamic response fibre.

The result is an exact decomposition of thermodynamic response energy into:

1. energy captured by a declared scalar response channel;
2. unused contractive reserve;
3. pairwise transverse response squares.

It is a finite positive-metric identity. It does not, by itself, identify a physical material, derive an equation of state, or prove that a chosen response decoder is realized by nature.

## 2. Typed thermodynamic response fibre

Let

\[
\mathcal R_{\rm th}\cong\mathbb C^m
\]

be a finite thermodynamic response fibre and let

\[
H_{\rm th}>0
\]

be its declared stable response metric. Define

\[
\langle u,v\rangle_{H_{\rm th}}=u^*H_{\rm th}v,
\qquad
\|u\|_{H_{\rm th}}^2=u^*H_{\rm th}u.
\]

Let

\[
y\in\mathcal R_{\rm th}
\]

be an actual response event and let

\[
c\in\mathcal R_{\rm th}
\]

be a declared thermodynamic decoder. Its scalar readout is

\[
L_c(y)=\langle c,y\rangle_{H_{\rm th}}.
\]

Put

\[
\beta_{\rm th}=\|c\|_{H_{\rm th}}^2.
\]

The metric-whitened coordinates are

\[
C=H_{\rm th}^{1/2}c,
\qquad
Y=H_{\rm th}^{1/2}y.
\]

All exterior-square expressions below are taken in these compatible whitened coordinates. Raw response coordinates with unlike physical units must not be wedged before the metric normalization is declared.

## 3. Exact thermodynamic cut-square identity

### Theorem 3.1

For every thermodynamic response event `y` and decoder `c`,

\[
\boxed{
\beta_{\rm th}\,\|y\|_{H_{\rm th}}^2
-
|L_c(y)|^2
=
\sum_{i<j}|C_iY_j-C_jY_i|^2.
}
\]

Equivalently,

\[
\boxed{
\|C\|^2\|Y\|^2-|\langle C,Y\rangle|^2
=
\|C\wedge Y\|^2.
}
\]

#### Proof

After whitening, the statement is the finite complex Lagrange identity

\[
\|C\|^2\|Y\|^2-|\langle C,Y\rangle|^2
=
\sum_{i<j}|C_iY_j-C_jY_i|^2.
\]

Since

\[
\|C\|^2=\beta_{\rm th},
\quad
\|Y\|^2=\|y\|_{H_{\rm th}}^2,
\quad
\langle C,Y\rangle=L_c(y),
\]

the thermodynamic form follows. QED.

## 4. Contractive response decomposition

### Theorem 4.1

If

\[
\beta_{\rm th}\le1,
\]

then

\[
\boxed{
\|y\|_{H_{\rm th}}^2-|L_c(y)|^2
=
(1-\beta_{\rm th})\|y\|_{H_{\rm th}}^2
+
\sum_{i<j}|C_iY_j-C_jY_i|^2
\ge0.
}
\]

Therefore

\[
\boxed{
H_{\rm th}-H_{\rm th}cc^*H_{\rm th}\ge0.
}
\]

#### Proof

Add

\[
(1-\beta_{\rm th})\|y\|_{H_{\rm th}}^2
\]

to both sides of Theorem 3.1. Every term on the right is nonnegative when `beta_th <= 1`. The operator statement is the same quadratic-form identity because

\[
y^*(H_{\rm th}-H_{\rm th}cc^*H_{\rm th})y
=
\|y\|_{H_{\rm th}}^2-|L_c(y)|^2.
\]

QED.

## 5. Four-channel thermodynamic tetrad

For the declared response tetrad

\[
X\in\{p,v,s,t\},
\]

the transverse residue contains exactly six pairwise squares:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\|C\wedge Y\|^2={}&
|C_pY_v-C_vY_p|^2
+|C_pY_s-C_sY_p|^2
+|C_pY_t-C_tY_p|^2\\
&+|C_vY_s-C_sY_v|^2
+|C_vY_t-C_tY_v|^2
+|C_sY_t-C_tY_s|^2.
\end{aligned}
\]

The `(p,v)` and `(s,t)` minors measure mismatch within the caloric and mechanical pairs. The remaining four minors measure cross-pair incompatibility. These names are interpretive labels only; the rigorous content is the positive metric-square decomposition.

## 6. Equality and no-leakage classification

### Corollary 6.1

If

\[
\beta_{\rm th}<1,
\]

then equality in Theorem 4.1 occurs only for

\[
y=0.
\]

If

\[
\beta_{\rm th}=1,
\]

then equality occurs exactly when

\[
C\wedge Y=0,
\]

or equivalently when

\[
Y=\alpha C
\]

for some scalar `alpha`.

Thus a unit decoder has no transverse leakage exactly when the complete metric-normalized response event lies on the one-dimensional constitutive line selected by that decoder.

This is a response-alignment statement. It is not automatically a claim of equilibrium, reversibility, or zero entropy production.

## 7. Sharp thermodynamic decoder burden

Suppose a declared scalar response functional `ell` admits at least one representation

\[
\ell(y)=\langle c,y\rangle_{H_{\rm th}}.
\]

Define its sharp thermodynamic burden

\[
\beta_{\rm th}^{\min}
=
\inf\left\{
\|c\|_{H_{\rm th}}^2:
\ell(y)=\langle c,y\rangle_{H_{\rm th}}
\text{ for all }y
\right\}.
\]

In a complete finite positive fibre the Riesz decoder is unique, so the infimum is attained. The native minimum-decoder theorem then specializes to

\[
\boxed{
H_{\rm th}-\ell^*\ell\ge0
\iff
\beta_{\rm th}^{\min}\le1.
}
\]

Any nonminimal enlarged event representation can only add orthogonal decoder energy. Constructing a decoder therefore does not prove contractivity; its sharp burden must still be bounded by one.

## 8. Onsager entropy-production specialization

Let the dissipative thermodynamic response metric be the positive symmetric Onsager part

\[
H_{\rm th}=L_{\rm sym}>0.
\]

Then

\[
\sigma(y)=y^*L_{\rm sym}y
\]

is the declared quadratic entropy-production form, and Theorem 4.1 gives

\[
\boxed{
\sigma(y)-|L_c(y)|^2
=
(1-\beta_{\rm th})\sigma(y)
+
\|C\wedge Y\|^2
\ge0.
}
\]

The antisymmetric Onsager component contributes no quadratic entropy production and is not part of this positive cut-square identity. It belongs to the orientation/circulation side of the Onsager compass developed elsewhere in this archive.

## 9. Relation to flat caloric-mechanical closure

The flat scalar relation

\[
\Gamma_c\Gamma_m=1
\]

checks one caloric-mechanical ratio. By contrast, cut-square closure at unit burden requires all six whitened pairwise minors to vanish.

Under the necessary nonzero-coordinate assumptions, complete cut-square closure can imply the corresponding ratio consistency. The converse is not generally valid: one scalar product identity can hold while one or more cross-response minors remain nonzero.

Therefore the cut-square theorem is a strictly finer response-coherence test than the flat closure relation.

## 10. Interface with the thermodynamic response cost

Let a source state `x` produce the thermodynamic response

\[
y=Bx
\]

and define the canonical response cost

\[
Q_{\rm th}=B^*H_{\rm th}B\ge0.
\]

Then a contractive decoder gives

\[
\boxed{
Q_{\rm th}
-
B^*H_{\rm th}cc^*H_{\rm th}B
\ge0.
}
\]

Pointwise on `x`, its defect is exactly the contractive reserve plus the thermodynamic cut-square residue of `Bx`.

This theorem controls extraction of one rank-one response channel from `Q_th`. The nonlinear barrier

\[
W_{\rm th}=I-e^{-Q_{\rm th}}
\]

remains the separate functional-calculus construction proved in the canonical response-cost capsule. No unproved commutation or direct identification between the rank-one cut defect and `W_th` is assumed here.
