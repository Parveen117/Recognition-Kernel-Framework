# Thermodynamic Projection-Defect and Source-Overlap Theorems

## 1. Projection defect

Let \(\mathcal R_{\mathrm{th}}\) be the span of the declared thermodynamic response vectors and let

\[
P_{\mathrm{th}}:\mathcal H\to\mathcal R_{\mathrm{th}}
\]

be the orthogonal projection.

For \(v\in\mathcal H\), define the thermodynamic recognition defect

\[
\boxed{
d_{\mathrm{th}}(v)=\|(I-P_{\mathrm{th}})v\|^2.
}
\]

## Theorem 1.1 (thermodynamic projection defect)

For every \(v\in\mathcal H\),

\[
\boxed{
\|v\|^2
=\|P_{\mathrm{th}}v\|^2+d_{\mathrm{th}}(v).
}
\]

Moreover,

\[
\boxed{
d_{\mathrm{th}}(v)=0
\iff
v\in\operatorname{Ran}P_{\mathrm{th}}.
}
\]

### Proof

The two vectors \(P_{\mathrm{th}}v\) and \((I-P_{\mathrm{th}})v\) are orthogonal. The first identity is Pythagoras. The second follows because a norm vanishes exactly on the zero vector. QED.

This theorem records an exact limitation: a finite response frame cannot recognize a component outside its span.

## 2. Thermodynamic source synthesis

Let

\[
S_{\mathrm{th}}:\mathbb C^m\to\mathcal H
\]

be the synthesis map of declared thermodynamic source vectors \(s_1,\ldots,s_m\), and define

\[
\boxed{
G_{\mathrm{th}}=S_{\mathrm{th}}^*S_{\mathrm{th}}.
}
\]

## Theorem 2.1 (source-overlap Gram identity)

The matrix \(G_{\mathrm{th}}\) is positive semidefinite and

\[
(G_{\mathrm{th}})_{ij}=\langle s_i,s_j\rangle.
\]

For every coefficient vector \(c\in\mathbb C^m\),

\[
\boxed{
c^*G_{\mathrm{th}}c=\|S_{\mathrm{th}}c\|^2\ge0.
}
\]

Hence

\[
\ker G_{\mathrm{th}}=\ker S_{\mathrm{th}}.
\]

### Proof

Directly,

\[
c^*G_{\mathrm{th}}c
=c^*S_{\mathrm{th}}^*S_{\mathrm{th}}c
=\|S_{\mathrm{th}}c\|^2.
\]

QED.

## 3. Event-resolved overlap

If each recognition event \(e\) supplies a response synthesis \(S_{\mathrm{th},e}\), then the event-resolved overlap kernel is

\[
G_{e,f}=S_{\mathrm{th},e}^*S_{\mathrm{th},f}.
\]

The block matrix \((G_{e,f})_{e,f}\) is positive semidefinite because it is the Gram matrix of the total event synthesis.
