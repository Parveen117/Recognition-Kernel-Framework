# Certified Cut-Graded Universal Generator Theorem

## 1. Certification status

The exact rational certificate and its ten focused tests have passed in the
user's local Jupyter worktree. The two repository workflows also passed on the
branch:

```text
RKF proof-lab CI                    PASS
Recognition Kernel Review          PASS
user-local exact theorem suite      PASS
```

The deterministic certificate target is

```text
PASS_CUT_GRADED_UNIVERSAL_GENERATOR_CANDIDATE
```

with pinned SHA-256

```text
34afc44543cd83cacd96cbced32b77f5fdd765c28fbaf81105d0d2063cf5f36e
```

The local console log and generated `ACTUAL.json` are not committed by this
status update; the user has reported the complete prescribed run as passing.
The algebraic theorem below is therefore promoted from candidate to the
certified central theorem of this branch. No claim is made that one particular
physical operator has already been proved universal.

## 2. Native data

Let \(\mathcal H\) be a Hilbert space and let

\[
J=J^*=J^{-1}
\]

be the primitive cut. Let \(G\) be a bounded operator on \(\mathcal H\). For an
unbounded generator, the same formulas are licensed on a common invariant core
provided

\[
J\operatorname{Dom}(G)=\operatorname{Dom}(G),
\]

and the relevant closures and functional calculi exist.

Define the cut projections

\[
P_\pm=\frac{I\pm J}{2}.
\]

The generator is not treated as an untyped sum of winding, phase, memory and
cost coordinates. Its first lawful structure is its grading relative to the
cut.

## 3. Central theorem

### Theorem 3.1 (Certified cut-graded universal-generator theorem)

Define

\[
\boxed{
G_{\mathrm e}=\frac12(G+JGJ),
\qquad
G_{\mathrm o}=\frac12(G-JGJ).
}
\tag{3.1}
\]

Then the following statements hold.

### (i) Unique cut grading

\[
\boxed{G=G_{\mathrm e}+G_{\mathrm o},}
\tag{3.2}
\]

\[
\boxed{
JG_{\mathrm e}J=G_{\mathrm e},
\qquad
JG_{\mathrm o}J=-G_{\mathrm o}.
}
\tag{3.3}
\]

The decomposition is unique. Moreover,

\[
P_+G_{\mathrm e}P_-=P_-G_{\mathrm e}P_+=0,
\tag{3.4}
\]

and

\[
P_+G_{\mathrm o}P_+=P_-G_{\mathrm o}P_-=0.
\tag{3.5}
\]

Thus \(G_{\mathrm e}\) preserves the two sheets, while \(G_{\mathrm o}\)
transports between them.

### (ii) Bilateral exponential reconstruction

Assume \(G\) is cut odd, so \(JGJ=-G\), and write

\[
U_t=e^{tG}.
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{JU_tJ=U_{-t}.}
\tag{3.6}
\]

Define

\[
E_t=\frac12(U_t+U_{-t})=\cosh(tG),
\qquad
O_t=\frac12(U_t-U_{-t})=\sinh(tG).
\tag{3.7}
\]

Then

\[
JE_tJ=E_t,
\qquad
JO_tJ=-O_t,
\tag{3.8}
\]

\[
\boxed{
U_t=E_t+O_t,
\qquad
U_{-t}=E_t-O_t,
}
\tag{3.9}
\]

and

\[
\boxed{E_t^2-O_t^2=I.}
\tag{3.10}
\]

### (iii) Exponential cut-square identity

For the derived channels

\[
\widehat J_t=U_t+U_{-t}=2\cosh(tG),
\qquad
\widehat C_t=U_t-U_{-t}=2\sinh(tG),
\tag{3.11}
\]

one has

\[
\boxed{\widehat J_t^2-\widehat C_t^2=4I,}
\tag{3.12}
\]

and

\[
\boxed{
\widehat J_t\widehat C_t
=
\widehat C_t\widehat J_t
=
U_{2t}-U_{-2t}
=
2\sinh(2tG).
}
\tag{3.13}
\]

Consequently the two cut/join products cannot be assigned different values
when both channels are functions of the same generator.

### (iv) Cut-loop memory and seam curvature

For a general generator, define

\[
\boxed{
\mathscr H_J(t)=JU_tJU_t=e^{tJGJ}e^{tG}.
}
\tag{3.14}
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{
\mathscr H_J(t)
=
I+2tG_{\mathrm e}
+t^2\left(2G_{\mathrm e}^2+[G_{\mathrm e},G_{\mathrm o}]\right)
+O(t^3),
}
\tag{3.15}
\]

and

\[
\boxed{
\log\mathscr H_J(t)
=
2tG_{\mathrm e}
+t^2[G_{\mathrm e},G_{\mathrm o}]
+O(t^3).
}
\tag{3.16}
\]

Hence

\[
\boxed{
G_{\mathrm e}
=
\frac12\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}\mathscr H_J(t),
}
\tag{3.17}
\]

and the first noncommutative seam-curvature coefficient is

\[
\boxed{
\mathcal R_{\mathrm{seam}}
=[G_{\mathrm e},G_{\mathrm o}].
}
\tag{3.18}
\]

The cut loop is locally the identity exactly when the generator is cut odd:

\[
\boxed{
\mathscr H_J(t)=I
\text{ for all sufficiently small }t
\iff
G_{\mathrm e}=0.
}
\tag{3.19}
\]

### (v) Periodic and antiperiodic closure

If

\[
G\psi=i\omega\psi,
\qquad \omega\in\mathbb R,
\]

then for every integer \(N\ge1\),

\[
U_N\psi=+\psi
\iff
N\omega\in2\pi\mathbb Z,
\tag{3.20}
\]

while

\[
U_N\psi=-\psi
\iff
N\omega\in(2\mathbb Z+1)\pi.
\tag{3.21}
\]

For \(\sigma\in\{+1,-1\}\), define

\[
D_{N,\sigma}=U_N-\sigma I,
\qquad
S_{N,\sigma}=D_{N,\sigma}^*D_{N,\sigma}.
\tag{3.22}
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{
S_{N,\sigma}\ge0,
\qquad
\ker S_{N,\sigma}=\ker(U_N-\sigma I).
}
\tag{3.23}
\]

The \(+1\) and \(-1\) closure sectors are distinct. A condition of the form
\(N\lambda=2\pi i m\) covers only the periodic sector.

### (vi) Clock-free Eye

Suppose

\[
U_t=e^{-itH},
\qquad H=H^*.
\]

Then the one-step Eye is

\[
\boxed{
\operatorname{Fix}(U_1)=E_H(2\pi\mathbb Z)\mathcal H,
}
\tag{3.24}
\]

whereas the clock-free Eye is

\[
\boxed{
\bigcap_{t\in\mathbb R}\operatorname{Fix}(U_t)=\ker H.
}
\tag{3.25}
\]

Its mean-ergodic projector is

\[
\boxed{
P_{\mathrm{Eye}}
=
\operatorname*{s-lim}_{T\to\infty}
\frac1T\int_0^T U_t\,dt
=
E_H(\{0\}).
}
\tag{3.26}
\]

Therefore

\[
\boxed{
\mathfrak B_{\mathrm{clock}}
=
\operatorname{Fix}(U_1)/\ker H
}
\tag{3.27}
\]

is the stroboscopic recognition-blind sector.

### (vii) Faithful component observer

Let \(P_1,\ldots,P_m\) be pairwise orthogonal projections satisfying

\[
\sum_{a=1}^mP_a=I,
\]

and define

\[
G_a=P_aG,
\qquad
\mathcal A_Gx=(G_1x,\ldots,G_mx).
\tag{3.28}
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{
\mathcal A_G^*\mathcal A_G
=
\sum_{a=1}^mG_a^*G_a
=
G^*G,
}
\tag{3.29}
\]

and hence

\[
\boxed{\ker\mathcal A_G=\ker G.}
\tag{3.30}
\]

If named components are not proved to arise from an orthogonal complete
projection family, their lawful observer is the direct sum, not merely their
aggregate. An aggregate can vanish by cancellation while the direct-sum energy
remains positive.

## 4. Proof

The formulas in (i) follow from \(J^2=I\). If
\(G=A+B\), \(JAJ=A\), and \(JBJ=-B\), then averaging \(G\) and \(JGJ\)
recovers \(A\) and \(B\), proving uniqueness. Multiplication by the cut
projections gives the block-support identities.

Under \(JGJ=-G\), functional calculus gives (3.6). Equations (3.7)--(3.10)
follow by symmetric and antisymmetric reconstruction. Since the derived
channels are functions of one operator, they commute; expanding their squares
and product gives (3.12)--(3.13).

For the cut loop, substitute

\[
JGJ=G_{\mathrm e}-G_{\mathrm o},
\qquad
G=G_{\mathrm e}+G_{\mathrm o},
\]

and multiply the two exponential series. This gives (3.15). The standard
second-order logarithm expansion gives (3.16). The first derivative gives
(3.17), and the quadratic logarithmic coefficient gives (3.18). If the loop is
locally the identity, its derivative vanishes, so \(G_{\mathrm e}=0\). The
converse follows from \(JU_tJ=U_{-t}\).

The closure statements follow by applying \(U_N\) to an eigenvector. The
positive source identity (3.23) is immediate from the definition of
\(D_{N,\sigma}\).

The spectral theorem gives (3.24)--(3.26). In particular, integer nonzero
frequencies can be invisible to a one-step fixed-point test, which produces the
quotient (3.27).

Finally,

\[
\sum_aG_a^*G_a
=
G^*\left(\sum_aP_a\right)G
=
G^*G,
\]

which proves the component-observer statement. \(\square\)

## 5. Recognition-Kernel flow consequence

For an observer \(B:\mathcal H\to\mathcal Y\) and times
\(\mathbf t=(t_1,\ldots,t_N)\), define

\[
\mathcal A_{\mathbf t}x
=
(BU_{t_1}x,\ldots,BU_{t_N}x).
\tag{5.1}
\]

For a target functional \(L\), put

\[
\beta_{\mathbf t}(L)
=
\sup_{\mathcal A_{\mathbf t}x\ne0}
\frac{|Lx|^2}{\|\mathcal A_{\mathbf t}x\|^2}.
\tag{5.2}
\]

Whenever the burden is finite, the Recognition-Kernel Theorem supplies a
unique minimum decoder

\[
c_L\in\overline{\operatorname{Ran}\mathcal A_{\mathbf t}}
\]

with

\[
Lx=\langle\mathcal A_{\mathbf t}x,c_L\rangle,
\qquad
\|c_L\|^2=\beta_{\mathbf t}(L),
\tag{5.3}
\]

and the exact flow cut-square criterion

\[
\boxed{
\mathcal A_{\mathbf t}^*\mathcal A_{\mathbf t}-L^*L\ge0
\iff
\beta_{\mathbf t}(L)\le1.
}
\tag{5.4}
\]

Thus the target-relative cost of recognizing a flow is a decoder burden, not an
unproved trace formula.

## 6. Corrected interpretation of the generator tower

The iteration

\[
G_{n+1}=2\sinh(G_n)
\]

does not converge to zero for a general real initial value, because the scalar
map has derivative \(2>1\) at zero. The lawful cut coordinate is instead

\[
C(G)=2\sinh(G/2),
\]

with inverse, wherever the functional calculus permits,

\[
\boxed{
G=2\operatorname{arsinh}(C(G)/2).
}
\tag{6.1}
\]

This is a reversible coordinate transformation, not a convergence theorem.

## 7. Certified exact packet

The passing rational packet verifies:

```text
unique cut-even/cut-odd decomposition;
cut-diagonal and trans-cut block support;
cut-loop linear memory coefficient;
cut-loop quadratic seam-curvature coefficient;
exact nilpotent odd bilateral flow;
exponential cut-square identity;
equality of the two derived cut/join products;
periodic and antiperiodic closure characters;
single-step versus all-time Eye;
orthogonal component Gram preservation;
nonorthogonal aggregate cancellation negative control.
```

The implementation uses `fractions.Fraction` only. No NumPy, floating point,
fitted unitary, source inverse, spectral eigensolver, or post-hoc Gram factor is
used.
