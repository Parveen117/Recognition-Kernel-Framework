# Native Prime--Gamma--Debt Source Adapter and Graph-Null Seam Theorem

## 1. Purpose

The Stage 3C metric-graph theorem constructs the completed-Weil boundary state
from the native metric,

\[
M_X=I+C_X^*C_X,
\qquad
r_\partial=M_X^{-1}q_b,
\]

\[
J_Xf=(f,C_Xf),
\qquad
p_X=J_Xr_\partial.
\]

The remaining source-adapter problem initially appeared to require a new map

\[
D_\Sigma:\mathcal G_X\longrightarrow\mathcal Y_\Sigma
\]

assembled event by event from every prime and Gamma coordinate.

That demand is too strong.  The complete native source analysis has already
been constructed upstream from the positive prime mismatch, positive Gamma
mismatch and exact diagonal debt:

\[
\mathcal A_{\rm mis}:
X_3^-\longrightarrow\mathcal Y_{\rm mis},
\]

\[
M_{\rm mis}=\mathcal A_{\rm mis}^*\mathcal A_{\rm mis},
\qquad
d_0=m_\Gamma+m_{\rm p},
\]

\[
D_{\rm comp}
=
\left(I-d_0M_{\rm mis}^{-1}\right)^{1/2},
\]

\[
\boxed{
\Xi_0=\mathcal A_{\rm mis}D_{\rm comp},
}
\]

\[
\boxed{
\Xi_0^*\Xi_0
=
M_{\rm mis}-d_0I
=
S_{0,-}^{\rm full}.
}
\]

Once both \(J_X\) and \(\Xi_0\) are native, the source adapter is forced by the
graph synthesis.  This stage constructs that adapter, classifies every other
adapter with the same pullback, and separates the now-closed adapter problem
from the still-open two-sheet decoder bound.

The native order is

```text
prime mismatch + Gamma mismatch
-> explicit diagonal debt
-> compatibility defect D_comp
-> complete source analysis Xi_0
-> native metric graph J_X
-> canonical source adapter D_Sigma^0=Xi_0 J_X^*
-> graph-null adapter freedom
-> two-sheet source domination
-> canonical boundary decoder.
```

No classical explicit formula, Birman--Schwinger inverse, fitted Gram factor or
post-hoc event rotation defines any object in this theorem.

---

## 2. Prime--Gamma mismatch and debt source

The positive mismatch carrier consists of:

```text
prime events:
  weights Lambda(n)/n^2;
  two-sheet mismatch vectors
  (1,-exp(-i xi log n));

Gamma events:
  weights (1/2) exp(-(k+1/4)t) dt;
  oscillator mismatches
  1-exp(i xi t/2).
```

The upstream factorization proves

\[
m_{\rm p}I_2-\mathcal Q(\xi)\ge0,
\]

and

\[
G(\xi)+m_\Gamma
=
\frac12
\sum_{k\ge0}\int_0^\infty
e^{-(k+1/4)t}
|1-e^{i\xi t/2}|^2\,dt
\ge0.
\]

Their direct-integral analysis is \(\mathcal A_{\rm mis}\).
The exact source accounting is

\[
S_{0,-}^{\rm full}
=
\mathcal A_{\rm mis}^*\mathcal A_{\rm mis}
-d_0I.
\]

The compatibility defect does not append a new arbitrary event.  It removes the
declared debt inside the same mismatch range:

\[
\Xi_0
=
\mathcal A_{\rm mis}
\left(I-d_0M_{\rm mis}^{-1}\right)^{1/2}.
\]

Consequently,

\[
\operatorname{Ran}\Xi_0
\subseteq
\overline{\operatorname{Ran}\mathcal A_{\rm mis}},
\]

so the source event orientation remains prime--Gamma native.

---

## 3. Native graph carrier

Let

\[
J_X:X_3^-\longrightarrow\mathcal G_X
\]

be the isometric native metric-graph analysis.  Put

\[
P_X=J_XJ_X^*,
\qquad
Q_X=I-P_X.
\]

Then

\[
J_X^*J_X=I,
\qquad
\operatorname{Ran}Q_X=\ker J_X^*.
\]

The graph-null seam \(\ker J_X^*\) consists of ambient event directions which
vanish under native graph synthesis.  Such directions are not deleted; they
are retained as recognition-null memory.

---

## 4. Canonical source-adapter theorem

### Theorem 4.1 (Canonical native source adapter)

Define

\[
\boxed{
D_\Sigma^0
=
\Xi_0J_X^*:
\mathcal G_X\longrightarrow\mathcal Y_\Sigma.
}
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{
D_\Sigma^0J_X=\Xi_0,
}
\tag{4.1}
\]

\[
\boxed{
D_\Sigma^0Q_X=0,
}
\tag{4.2}
\]

and

\[
\boxed{
J_X^*(D_\Sigma^0)^*D_\Sigma^0J_X
=
\Xi_0^*\Xi_0
=
S_{0,-}^{\rm full}.
}
\tag{4.3}
\]

#### Proof

Since \(J_X^*J_X=I\),

\[
D_\Sigma^0J_X
=
\Xi_0J_X^*J_X
=
\Xi_0.
\]

Also \(J_X^*Q_X=0\), so

\[
D_\Sigma^0Q_X
=
\Xi_0J_X^*Q_X
=
0.
\]

Finally, pull back the adapter Gram through \(J_X\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
J_X^*(D_\Sigma^0)^*D_\Sigma^0J_X
&=
(D_\Sigma^0J_X)^*(D_\Sigma^0J_X)\\
&=
\Xi_0^*\Xi_0\\
&=
S_{0,-}^{\rm full}.
\end{aligned}
\]

\(\square\)

The actual source adapter is therefore no longer an open construction.  It is
the native source analysis followed by graph synthesis.

---

## 5. All adapters form one graph-null affine family

### Theorem 5.1 (Graph-null adapter classification)

Let

\[
D_\Sigma:\mathcal G_X\to\mathcal Y_\Sigma
\]

be bounded.  Then

\[
D_\Sigma J_X=\Xi_0
\]

if and only if there is a bounded map \(E\) such that

\[
\boxed{
D_\Sigma
=
D_\Sigma^0+EQ_X.
}
\tag{5.1}
\]

#### Proof

Every map of the form (5.1) satisfies

\[
D_\Sigma J_X
=
D_\Sigma^0J_X+EQ_XJ_X
=
\Xi_0.
\]

Conversely, if \(D_\Sigma J_X=\Xi_0\), then

\[
(D_\Sigma-D_\Sigma^0)P_X
=
(D_\Sigma-D_\Sigma^0)J_XJ_X^*
=
0.
\]

Hence

\[
D_\Sigma-D_\Sigma^0
=
(D_\Sigma-D_\Sigma^0)Q_X,
\]

which is (5.1) with \(E=D_\Sigma-D_\Sigma^0\).

\(\square\)

Thus adapter nonuniqueness lives entirely on the graph-null seam.  It cannot
change the physical source pullback.

---

## 6. Boundary recognition class is adapter invariant

The metric-graph boundary state is

\[
p_X=J_Xr_\partial,
\]

and

\[
L_\partial(f)
=
\langle p_X,J_Xf\rangle_{\mathcal G_X}.
\]

A source decoder \(c_\partial\in\mathcal Y_\Sigma\) satisfies

\[
\Xi_0^*c_\partial=r_\partial
\]

exactly when

\[
L_\partial(f)
=
\langle c_\partial,\Xi_0f\rangle_\Sigma.
\]

### Theorem 6.1 (Adapter-independent quotient decoder)

Let

\[
D_\Sigma^E=D_\Sigma^0+EQ_X.
\]

If

\[
\Xi_0^*c_\partial=r_\partial,
\]

then

\[
\boxed{
p_X-(D_\Sigma^E)^*c_\partial
\in\ker J_X^*.
}
\tag{6.1}
\]

For the canonical adapter,

\[
\boxed{
(D_\Sigma^0)^*c_\partial=p_X.
}
\tag{6.2}
\]

#### Proof

For the canonical adapter,

\[
(D_\Sigma^0)^*c_\partial
=
J_X\Xi_0^*c_\partial
=
J_Xr_\partial
=
p_X.
\]

For a general adapter,

\[
(D_\Sigma^E)^*c_\partial
=
p_X+Q_XE^*c_\partial.
\]

Therefore

\[
p_X-(D_\Sigma^E)^*c_\partial
=
-Q_XE^*c_\partial
\in\operatorname{Ran}Q_X
=
\ker J_X^*.
\]

\(\square\)

This is the exact Recognition-Seam statement:

\[
\boxed{
\text{different ambient adapters represent one boundary object
when they differ only by graph-null memory.}
}
\]

---

## 7. Canonical minimum decoder after a relative bound

Suppose a native estimate proves

\[
|L_\partial(f)|^2
\le
\beta\|\Xi_0f\|_\Sigma^2
\qquad(f\in X_3^-)
\]

for some finite \(\beta\).

Then \(L_\partial\) vanishes on \(\ker\Xi_0\) and defines a bounded functional
on \(\operatorname{Ran}\Xi_0\).  Recognition completion produces a unique
minimum decoder

\[
c_{\partial,\min}
\in\overline{\operatorname{Ran}\Xi_0}
\]

such that

\[
\Xi_0^*c_{\partial,\min}=r_\partial
\]

and

\[
\boxed{
\|c_{\partial,\min}\|_\Sigma^2
=
\beta_{\rm cut}
\le\beta.
}
\tag{7.1}
\]

Consequently,

\[
\boxed{
S_{0,-}^{\rm full}
-
L_\partial^*L_\partial
\ge
(1-\beta)
S_{0,-}^{\rm full}.
}
\tag{7.2}
\]

The decoder is therefore forced after the bound.  It is not fitted and then
declared contractive.

---

## 8. Event-coordinate covariance

Let

\[
U:\mathcal Y_\Sigma\to\mathcal Y_\Sigma'
\]

be unitary.  Define

\[
\Xi_0'=U\Xi_0,
\qquad
D_\Sigma'=UD_\Sigma,
\qquad
c_\partial'=Uc_\partial.
\]

Then

\[
(\Xi_0')^*\Xi_0'=\Xi_0^*\Xi_0,
\]

\[
(D_\Sigma')J_X=\Xi_0',
\]

\[
(\Xi_0')^*c_\partial'=\Xi_0^*c_\partial,
\]

and

\[
\|c_\partial'\|=\|c_\partial\|.
\]

Thus the actual event-coordinate chart may rotate, but the source Gram,
boundary recognition class, burden and cut covariance are invariant.

This explains why Stage 3A's request for every individual event phase was
unnecessarily rigid.  The lawful invariant is the source adapter and quotient
boundary class.

---

## 9. Robust two-sheet attachment theorem

The remaining actual issue is no longer the source adapter.  It is the
attachment of the direct cut envelope to the actual source and boundary in one
two-sheet chart.

Let \(\beta_{\rm env}\) be a charted boundary/source envelope.  Assume:

\[
\mathcal E_{\rm chart}(f)
\le
\frac{1}{1-\varepsilon_S}
\|\Xi_0f\|_\Sigma^2,
\qquad
0\le\varepsilon_S<1,
\]

and

\[
|L_\partial(f)-L_{\rm chart}(f)|
\le
\delta_\partial\|\Xi_0f\|_\Sigma.
\]

If

\[
|L_{\rm chart}(f)|^2
\le
\beta_{\rm env}\mathcal E_{\rm chart}(f),
\]

then

\[
\boxed{
\sqrt{\beta_{\rm cut}}
\le
\sqrt{\frac{\beta_{\rm env}}{1-\varepsilon_S}}
+
\delta_\partial.
}
\tag{9.1}
\]

#### Proof

For every \(f\),

\[
\begin{aligned}
|L_\partial(f)|
&\le
|L_{\rm chart}(f)|
+
|L_\partial(f)-L_{\rm chart}(f)|\\
&\le
\sqrt{\beta_{\rm env}}\,
\mathcal E_{\rm chart}(f)^{1/2}
+
\delta_\partial\|\Xi_0f\|_\Sigma\\
&\le
\left(
\sqrt{\frac{\beta_{\rm env}}{1-\varepsilon_S}}
+
\delta_\partial
\right)
\|\Xi_0f\|_\Sigma.
\end{aligned}
\]

Take the sharp supremum.

\(\square\)

For the imported direct-unshifted envelope

\[
\beta_{\rm env}
=
0.8290856201657449,
\]

the exact relative reserve is

\[
1-\beta_{\rm env}
=
0.1709143798342551.
\]

If the source attachment is exact, the allowed boundary residual is

\[
\boxed{
\delta_\partial
<
1-\sqrt{\beta_{\rm env}}
=
0.0894586115031646185\ldots
}
\]

If the source chart loses at most five percent, the residual budget remains

\[
\delta_\partial
<
0.0658042467246887\ldots
\]

and at ten percent source loss it remains

\[
\delta_\partial
<
0.0402051028325867\ldots
\]

Thus the next theorem need not be a symbolic miracle.  It may be an exact
attachment or a directed residual enclosure with a substantial budget.

## 10. Exact Stage 3D calibration

The exact rational packet uses six mismatch rows:

```text
prime singular amplitudes   5, 9, 12
Gamma singular amplitudes   12, 12, 16
```

so

\[
M_{\rm mis}
=
\operatorname{diag}(169,225,400).
\]

With debt

\[
d_0=144
\]

and compatibility defect

\[
D_{\rm comp}
=
\operatorname{diag}
\left(
\frac5{13},
\frac35,
\frac45
\right),
\]

the source Gram is

\[
\Xi^*\Xi
=
\operatorname{diag}(25,81,256)
=
M_{\rm mis}-144I.
\]

A rational graph isometry \(J\) is used to construct

\[
D_\Sigma^0=\Xi J^*.
\]

The packet verifies:

```text
D_Sigma^0 J = Xi;
D_Sigma^0 Q_graph = 0;
all alternate adapters differ by E Q_graph;
alternate boundary states differ only by ker(J*);
event-coordinate rotations preserve the source and decoder;
minimum decoder burden = 361/900;
relative reserve = 539/900;
cut covariance is positive definite.
```

These are exact Fraction calculations.

## 11. Actual completed-Weil status

Xi_0=D_Sigma^0 J_X                                 PROVED HERE
```

Therefore:

\[
\boxed{
\text{ACTUAL SOURCE ADAPTER = CONSTRUCTED.}
}
\]

Still open:

```text
actual two-sheet Loewner source domination;
actual boundary density in that same chart;
promotion of the T21 scalar envelope to beta_cut;
actual minimum completed-Weil decoder;
actual cut covariance;
RH.
```

---

## 12. Next theorem: Stage 3E

The next development is the

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Native Two-Sheet Source-Domination Attachment Theorem.}
}
\]

It must construct a two-sheet chart

\[
J_{\rm 2sh}:X_3^-\to
L^2(\mathbb R;\mathbb C^2)
\]

from the already declared prime/Gamma mismatch analysis and prove:

\[
\boxed{
\|\Xi_0f\|_\Sigma^2
\ge
\int_{\mathbb R}
\langle
J_{\rm 2sh}f(\xi),
A_0(\xi)J_{\rm 2sh}f(\xi)
\rangle
\,d\xi,
}
\tag{12.1}
\]

together with

\[
\boxed{
L_\partial(f)
=
\int_{\mathbb R}
\langle
b_\partial(\xi),
J_{\rm 2sh}f(\xi)
\rangle
\,d\xi.
}
\tag{12.2}
\]

The directed cell floors and actual boundary envelope must then be shown to
bound (12.1)--(12.2), exactly or with the residuals in Theorem 9.1.

If this stage attaches the existing envelope

\[
\beta_{\rm env}\le0.8290856201657449,
\]

then Recognition completion forces

\[
\|c_{\partial,\min}\|^2
\le0.8290856201657449<1
\]

and

\[
S_{0,-}^{\rm full}
-
L_\partial^*L_\partial
\ge
0.1709143798342551
S_{0,-}^{\rm full}.
\]
