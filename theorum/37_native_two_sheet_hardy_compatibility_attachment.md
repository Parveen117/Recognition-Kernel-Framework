# Native Two-Sheet Hardy Boundary and Compatibility-Transfer Theorem

## 1. Purpose

The native prime--Gamma--debt source adapter is now constructed:

\[
\Xi_0=\mathcal A_{\rm mis}D_{\rm comp},
\qquad
\Xi_0^*\Xi_0=S_{0,-}^{\rm full}.
\]

The native metric graph also generates the physical odd boundary state. The
remaining problem is not the existence of a source adapter and not the
existence of the boundary functional. It is to place them in one actual
source-dominating two-sheet chart.

This stage proves the boundary half of that attachment exactly. The Hardy strip
already carried by the native exponential spatial energy has an explicit
Cauchy boundary kernel. Therefore the completion-boundary evaluation is a
first moment of the declared two-sheet Hardy boundary values, not an imported
row.

The stage then identifies the only remaining displacement. The prime--Gamma
mismatch uses the raw two-sheet chart, while the physical source uses that chart
after the compatibility defect. The boundary density must therefore be
transported through the same defect on its positive support.

The corrected order is

```text
native Hardy strip
-> exact two-sheet Cauchy boundary density
-> raw prime--Gamma two-sheet mismatch chart
-> compatibility defect on that chart
-> support-range test for the boundary density
-> transformed boundary density
-> source domination / direct T21 envelope
-> completed-Weil cut covariance.
```

## 2. Native two-sheet Hardy chart

Let

\[
S_a=\{z\in\mathbb C:|\operatorname{Im}z|<a\},
\qquad a=\frac32.
\]

For a native odd state, the exponential spatial channel gives a Hardy function
\(\Phi_f\in H^2(S_a)\). Put

\[
\Phi_f^-(\xi)=\Phi_f(\xi-ia),
\qquad
\Phi_f^+(\xi)=\Phi_f(\xi+ia),
\]

and define the two-sheet chart

\[
\boxed{
J_{\rm 2sh}f=(\Phi_f^-,\Phi_f^+)
\in
L^2\!\left(\mathbb R,\frac{d\xi}{2\pi};\mathbb C^2\right).
}
\]

The source construction upstream uses these same two Hardy boundary channels
for the prime two-sheet mismatch and Gamma oscillator mismatch.

---

## 3. Strip Cauchy boundary density

Let \(|y|<a\). Cauchy's formula on an expanding rectangle in the strip gives

\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\Phi(iy)
={}&
\int_{\mathbb R}
\frac{-i\,\Phi^-(\xi)}{\xi-i(a+y)}\,\frac{d\xi}{2\pi}
\\
&+
\int_{\mathbb R}
\frac{i\,\Phi^+(\xi)}{\xi+i(a-y)}\,\frac{d\xi}{2\pi}.
\end{aligned}
}
\tag{3.1}
\]

The signs swap if the opposite Fourier convention is used. The two sheet
masses and their sum do not change.

### Theorem 3.1 (Exact strip boundary first moment)

There is a unique two-sheet Cauchy density \(k_{a,y}\) in the Hardy boundary
space such that

\[
\boxed{
\Phi(iy)=\langle k_{a,y},J_{\rm 2sh}\Phi\rangle.
}
\]

Its sheet masses are

\[
\boxed{
\|k_{a,y}^-\|^2
=\frac{1}{2(a+y)},
\qquad
\|k_{a,y}^+\|^2
=\frac{1}{2(a-y)},
}
\tag{3.2}
\]

and

\[
\boxed{
\|k_{a,y}\|^2
=\frac{a}{a^2-y^2}.
}
\tag{3.3}
\]

#### Proof

Equation (3.1) is a bounded functional on the two boundary lines. The Riesz
representer is obtained by reading off the two Cauchy kernels. Since

\[
\int_{\mathbb R}\frac{d\xi}{2\pi(\xi^2+c^2)}
=\frac1{2c},
\]

one obtains (3.2); addition gives (3.3). ∎

For

\[
a=\frac32,
\qquad
|y|=\frac12,
\]

one sheet has mass \(1/4\), the other has mass \(1/2\), and

\[
\boxed{
\|k_{3/2,\,1/2}\|^2=\frac34.
}
\]

Reflection swaps the two sheet masses and preserves their sum.

The actual odd completion boundary is

\[
L_\partial f=\sqrt2\,\widehat f(i/2).
\]

Therefore

\[
\boxed{
L_\partial f
=
\langle b_{\partial,{\rm 2sh}},J_{\rm 2sh}f\rangle,
\qquad
b_{\partial,{\rm 2sh}}
=\sqrt2\,k_{3/2,\,\pm1/2},
}
\tag{3.4}
\]

followed by the declared odd/reflection projection. The sign of the evaluation
height depends only on the pinned Fourier convention. Equation (3.4) is
unchanged as a physical odd functional.

Thus the actual boundary is now attached to the declared two-sheet Hardy chart.

---

## 4. Compatibility displacement of the source chart

Let \(J=J_{\rm 2sh}\). The raw positive mismatch analysis factors through this
chart. Write it schematically as

\[
\mathcal A_{\rm mis}=\mathcal M_{\rm mis}J.
\]

The completed pure source is not the raw mismatch. It is obtained after the
exact diagonal debt is paid:

\[
\Xi_0
=\mathcal A_{\rm mis}D_{\rm comp}.
\]

On the two-sheet chart range define

\[
\boxed{
C_{\rm comp}=JD_{\rm comp}J^*.
}
\tag{4.1}
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{
JD_{\rm comp}=C_{\rm comp}J
}
\tag{4.2}
\]

and

\[
\Xi_0
=\mathcal M_{\rm mis}C_{\rm comp}J.
\]

The boundary density in (3.4) pairs with \(Jf\), while the source event analysis
sees \(C_{\rm comp}Jf\). This is the precise remaining attachment problem.

---

## 5. Compatibility-transfer theorem

### Theorem 5.1 (Boundary transfer through the source defect)

Let \(C\ge0\) be a contraction on a chart space and let

\[
L(f)=\langle b,Jf\rangle.
\]

The following are equivalent:

1. \(b\in\operatorname{Ran}C^*\) on the positive support;
2. there exists a minimum-norm density
   \[
   \widetilde b=C^{\dagger,*}b
   \]
   such that
   \[
   L(f)=\langle\widetilde b,CJf\rangle;
   \]
3. \(b\) vanishes on \(\ker C\).

When these conditions hold, every raw source domination

\[
\|\Xi f\|^2
\ge
\langle CJf,A\,CJf\rangle
\]

gives

\[
\boxed{
|L(f)|^2
\le
\langle\widetilde b,A^\dagger\widetilde b\rangle
\,\|\Xi f\|^2.
}
\tag{5.1}
\]

#### Proof

The equivalence is the support form of the Moore--Penrose range theorem. Under
it,

\[
b=C^*\widetilde b,
\]

so

\[
L(f)=\langle\widetilde b,CJf\rangle.
\]

Apply Cauchy--Schwarz in the positive \(A\)-metric. ∎

This theorem explains why an untransformed boundary mass table cannot be
attached blindly to the post-debt source. The density consumed by the source
ledger must be \(\widetilde b\), not merely \(b\).

---

## 6. Zero remembers the compatibility cut

If \(C\) has a kernel, a component of \(b\) in that kernel cannot be decoded by
the physical source. It is not a small numerical error. It is directional
cut memory.

### Corollary 6.1 (Zero-cut support gate)

\[
\boxed{
P_{\ker C}b=0
}
\tag{6.1}
\]

is necessary and sufficient for a finite compatibility-transferred boundary
burden. A nonzero kernel component forces the source-relative burden to be
infinite.

This is the operator form of the doctrine

```text
positive spectrum transports;
zero spectrum remembers which side of the compatibility cut was lost.
```

---

## 7. Robust source-loss and boundary-residual theorem

Let \(\beta_{\rm env}<1\) be a chart envelope for a candidate transformed
boundary density. Suppose the actual source dominates the chart with relative
loss \(0\le\varepsilon_S<1\), and the remaining boundary pairing residual has
source-relative norm at most \(\delta_\partial\). Then

\[
\boxed{
\sqrt{\beta_{\rm actual}}
\le
\sqrt{\frac{\beta_{\rm env}}{1-\varepsilon_S}}
+\delta_\partial.
}
\tag{7.1}
\]

Therefore the actual decoder is contractive whenever the right side is below
one.

For the direct T21 envelope

\[
\beta_{\rm env}=0.8290856201657449,
\]

the available boundary-residual budgets are approximately

```text
source loss 0%    0.0894586115031646
source loss 5%    0.0658042467246887
source loss 10%   0.0402051028325867.
```

At ten percent source loss and residual \(0.04\), the robust burden remains
strictly below one.

## 8. Exact generalized calibrations

The executable Stage 3E packet verifies:

```text
strip a=3/2, evaluation |y|=1/2:
  sheet masses                    1/4 and 1/2
  total evaluation-kernel mass   3/4

compatibility-transfer model:
  raw mismatch source             diag(4,9,16)
  compatibility defect            diag(1/2,2/3,3/4)
  completed source Gram           diag(1,4,9)
  transformed/actual burden       397/5184

zero-cut support model:
  compatibility defect            diag(1/2,2/3,0)
  supported burden                97/1296
  nonzero kernel boundary         rejected.
```

A wrong sheet orientation preserves coefficient masses but changes the boundary
functional. Orientation still matters before the exact Cauchy density and
compatibility transfer are fixed.

---

## 9. Actual completed-Weil gate

Stage 3E closes

\[
\boxed{
L_\partial(f)
=\langle b_{\partial,{\rm 2sh}},J_{\rm 2sh}f\rangle.
}
\]

The remaining actual theorem is now only:

\[
\boxed{
b_{\partial,{\rm 2sh}}
\in\operatorname{Ran}C_{\rm comp}^*,}
\tag{9.1}
\]

construct

\[
\boxed{
\widetilde b_\partial
=C_{\rm comp}^{\dagger,*}b_{\partial,{\rm 2sh}},}
\tag{9.2}
\]

and prove that the T21 cut profile is a Loewner lower source chart for that
transformed density:

\[
\boxed{
\|\Xi_0f\|^2
\ge
(1-\varepsilon_S)
\int
\langle C_{\rm comp}J_{\rm 2sh}f,
A_{\rm T21}
C_{\rm comp}J_{\rm 2sh}f\rangle.
}
\tag{9.3}
\]

If (9.1)--(9.3) are exact, the T21 envelope gives

\[
\|c_\partial\|^2
\le0.8290856201657449<1.
\]

A directed residual version is already licensed by (7.1).
