# Native Source-Kernel No-Blindness and Strict Odd Cut Theorem

## 1. Purpose

Stage 3F constructs the actual completed odd source decoder and proves the
relative cut-covariance estimate

\[
S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}-L_\partial^*L_\partial
\ge
\delta_{\rm cut}S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}},
\]

where

\[
\beta_\partial^{\mathrm{cut}}
\le 0.8290856201657449,
\qquad
\delta_{\rm cut}
=1-\beta_\partial^{\mathrm{cut}}
\ge0.1709143798342551.
\]

This proves nonnegativity, but strict positivity on every nonzero odd state
requires one further statement:

\[
\boxed{
\ker S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}
=
\ker\Xi_0
=
\{0\}.
}
\]

The present stage attaches no-blindness to the same two-sheet source carrier
used in Stage 3F.  It does not consume the classical explicit formula, an even
sector, a five-dimensional endpoint matrix, an attained threshold vector, or a
uniform ambient spectral gap.

The native order is

```text
actual prime--Gamma--debt analysis Xi_0
-> actual two-sheet chart J_2sh
-> T21 lower cut profile s_T21
-> zero-cut no-blindness
-> source-kernel injectivity
-> strict relative odd cut covariance.
```

## 2. Abstract cut-source no-blindness theorem

Let

\[
\Xi:\mathcal H\longrightarrow\mathcal Y
\]

be a bounded event analysis and let

\[
J:\mathcal H\longrightarrow L^2(X,\mu;\mathbb C^d)
\]

be an injective recognition chart.  Suppose there is a measurable function
\(s:X\to[0,\infty)\) satisfying

\[
\boxed{
\|\Xi f\|_{\mathcal Y}^2
\ge
\int_X s(x)\|Jf(x)\|^2\,d\mu(x)
}
\tag{2.1}
\]

for every \(f\in\mathcal H\).  Let

\[
Z_s=\{x:s(x)=0\}.
\]

### Theorem 2.1 (Null-cut source injectivity)

If

\[
\mu(Z_s)=0,
\]

then

\[
\boxed{
\ker\Xi=\{0\}.
}
\tag{2.2}
\]

#### Proof

Let \(\Xi f=0\).  Equation (2.1) gives

\[
\int_X s(x)\|Jf(x)\|^2\,d\mu(x)=0.
\]

The integrand is nonnegative.  Since \(s>0\) almost everywhere outside the
null set \(Z_s\), one has

\[
Jf=0
\quad\text{almost everywhere on }X.
\]

Injectivity of \(J\) gives \(f=0\). ∎

The theorem does not require \(\inf s>0\).  The lower chart may approach zero
at the cut, so zero can remain in the continuous or essential spectral
closure.  What is excluded is an attained nonzero source-null state.

---

## 3. Positive-measure active-band variant

Sometimes a source certificate is available only on a declared active band.
Let \(E\subseteq X\) have positive measure and assume

\[
\|\Xi f\|^2
\ge
\int_E h(x)\|Jf(x)\|^2\,d\mu(x),
\qquad
h>0\ \text{a.e. on }E.
\tag{3.1}
\]

### Theorem 3.1 (Recognition-unique active observer)

Assume the chart has the uniqueness property

\[
1_EJf=0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
f=0.
\tag{3.2}
\]

Then \(\ker\Xi=\{0\}\).

#### Proof

If \(\Xi f=0\), (3.1) forces \(Jf=0\) almost everywhere on \(E\), and (3.2)
then gives \(f=0\). ∎

For Hardy boundary charts, (3.2) is the boundary uniqueness/no-blindness
property.  This theorem is the direct recognition form of the covariant
active-band virial route already proved in the MP source stack.

---

## 4. Application to the actual completed odd source

Stage 3D constructs

\[
\Xi_0
=\mathcal A_{\rm mis}D_{\rm comp},
\qquad
\Xi_0^*\Xi_0
=S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}.
\tag{4.1}
\]

Stage 3E constructs the native two-sheet Hardy chart

\[
J_{\rm 2sh}:X_3^-\longrightarrow
L^2\!\left(\mathbb R,\frac{d\xi}{2\pi};\mathbb C^2\right).
\tag{4.2}
\]

Stage 3F attaches the actual prime--Gamma--debt source symbol to that chart and
proves the T21 Loewner lower estimate

\[
\boxed{
\|\Xi_0f\|^2
\ge
\int_{\mathbb R}
 s_{\rm T21}(\xi)
 \|J_{\rm 2sh}f(\xi)\|^2
 \frac{d\xi}{2\pi}.
}
\tag{4.3}
\]

The cut profile satisfies:

```text
first cut:
  s_T21(xi) >= (gamma_0/2) xi^2,
  gamma_0 = 28.96922744937062;

remaining active cells:
  every cumulative source floor is strictly positive;

[12,13]:
  source floor >= 0.4571260170709391;

far ray:
  source floor >= 0.1568358628972386.
```

Hence

\[
s_{\rm T21}(\xi)>0
\quad\text{for almost every }\xi\ne0,
\]

and the only zero cut is the singleton \(\{0\}\), which has Lebesgue measure
zero.

### Theorem 4.1 (Actual source-kernel no-blindness)

On the Stage 3F completed odd carrier,

\[
\boxed{
\ker\Xi_0
=
\ker S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}
=
\{0\}.
}
\tag{4.4}
\]

#### Proof

Apply Theorem 2.1 to (4.3).  Since

\[
S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}=\Xi_0^*\Xi_0,
\]

one has

\[
\ker S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}=\ker\Xi_0.
\]

The two-sheet Hardy chart is injective, so (4.4) follows. ∎

### Independent source pin

The MP T20 theorem proves the same conclusion by a covariant cut-flow
commutator and Hardy no-blindness.  In that route a hypothetical zero source
state has zero virial expectation, while the positive active-band commutator
and Hardy uniqueness force the same expectation to be strictly positive.  The
Stage 3G direct proof and the T20 virial proof are independent presentations of
the same native no-blindness mechanism.

---

## 5. Strict odd completed-Weil positivity

Put

\[
W_3^-
=
S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}-L_\partial^*L_\partial.
\]

Stage 3F proves

\[
W_3^-
\ge
\delta_{\rm cut}S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}},
\qquad
\delta_{\rm cut}
=0.1709143798342551.
\tag{5.1}
\]

### Theorem 5.1 (Strict odd cut theorem)

For every nonzero odd native state \(f\),

\[
\boxed{
\langle f,W_3^-f\rangle
\ge
0.1709143798342551
\langle f,S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}f\rangle
>0.
}
\tag{5.2}
\]

#### Proof

Theorem 4.1 gives

\[
\langle f,S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}f\rangle
=\|\Xi_0f\|^2>0
\]

for every nonzero \(f\).  Substitute this into (5.1). ∎

The theorem is strict in the quadratic-form sense.  It does not claim a bound

\[
W_3^-\ge cI
\]

in the ambient carrier norm.  The source floor vanishes at the cut and may
approach zero under refinement, so the spectrum may still accumulate at zero
without possessing a zero eigenvector.

---

## 6. Injective cut-covariance bridge

Stage 3A gives an enlarged event lift \(\widehat\Xi_0\) and a unit boundary
state \(p_\partial\) such that

\[
W_3^-
=
\widehat\Xi_0^*
(I-p_\partial p_\partial^*)
\widehat\Xi_0.
\tag{6.1}
\]

Let

\[
Q_\partial=I-p_\partial p_\partial^*.
\]

### Corollary 6.1 (Boundary-line no-blindness)

\[
\boxed{
\ker(Q_\partial\widehat\Xi_0)=\{0\}.
}
\tag{6.2}
\]

#### Proof

If \(Q_\partial\widehat\Xi_0f=0\), then (6.1) gives

\[
\langle f,W_3^-f\rangle=0.
\]

Theorem 5.1 implies \(f=0\). ∎

Thus the source, boundary and remaining cut memory form one injective
co-generated event object.

---

## 7. Exact generalized calibration

The executable packet uses the odd polynomial family

\[
p(x)=a x+b x^3+c x^5.
\]

The cut row at \(x=0\) vanishes for every state.  Three active rows at
\(x=1,2,3\) form the exact matrix

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1&1&1\\
2&8&32\\
3&27&243
\end{pmatrix},
\]

whose determinant is

\[
720\ne0.
\]

Thus the zero cut carries no source rank, while the active observer recovers
the complete odd state.  The source Gram has determinant

\[
518400>0.
\]

With decoder

\[
c=(0,1/2,1/3,1/4),
\]

one has

\[
\|c\|^2=\frac{61}{144},
\qquad
1-\|c\|^2=\frac{83}{144},
\]

and the exact cut covariance has determinant

\[
298800>0.
\]

A negative control retains only the active nodes \(1,2\).  The nonzero odd
polynomial

\[
p(x)=x(4-5x^2+x^4)
\]

then vanishes at the cut and both observed nodes.  The third active node detects
it with value \(120\).  This proves that positive weights do not replace a
no-blindness/uniqueness theorem.

---

## 8. Noncoercive strictness calibration

The packet also considers

\[
S_N=\operatorname{diag}(1,1/2,\ldots,1/N),
\qquad
W_N=\frac15S_N.
\]

Every finite source and strict form has trivial kernel, and the relative reserve
is exactly \(1/5\).  Nevertheless,

\[
\lambda_{\min}(S_N)=\frac1N\to0,
\qquad
\lambda_{\min}(W_N)=\frac1{5N}\to0.
\]

This is the exact distinction used in the completed endpoint:

```text
strict positivity on every nonzero state     proved;
uniform ambient coercivity                    not asserted.
```

---

## 9. Next membrane

Stage 3G closes the native odd sign.  It deliberately stops before the
classical target interface.

The next theorem must establish, term by term and in one Fourier convention,
that the native odd form equals the odd restriction of the classical completed
explicit-formula Weil form.  It must match:

```text
completion-boundary term;
Gamma term;
prime-power term;
reflection and conjugation convention;
logarithmic/multiplicative unitary normalization;
test-core density.
```

Only after that normalization theorem is proved may a parity-restricted
classical Weil implication be consumed.
