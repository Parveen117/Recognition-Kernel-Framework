## 1. Seam-dagger lift

On

\[
\mathcal H=\mathbb C^2_{\mathrm{seam}}\otimes\mathbb C^2_{\mathrm{int}},
\]

let

\[
R^2=-I,
\qquad K^2=I,
\qquad RK=-KR,
\qquad X^\sharp=KX^*K.
\]

If \(A(t)\in\mathfrak{su}(2)\) and \(\widetilde A(t)=I_2\otimes A(t)\), then

\[
\widetilde A(t)^\sharp=-\widetilde A(t).
\]

Consequently its transport is dagger-unitary:

\[
\widetilde U(t)^\sharp\widetilde U(t)=I.
\]

## 2. Noncommutative path-order theorem

For piecewise-constant segments,

\[
U_C=e^{\Delta t_NA_N}\cdots e^{\Delta t_1A_1}.
\]

For

\[
A_x=-i\alpha\sigma_x,
\qquad
A_z=-i\beta\sigma_z,
\]

one has

\[
[A_x,A_z]=2i\alpha\beta\sigma_y\neq0
\]

when \(\alpha\beta\neq0\). Therefore

\[
U_{xz}=e^{A_z}e^{A_x}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
U_{zx}=e^{A_x}e^{A_z}
\]

need not coincide.

## 3. Spectral-shadow collision theorem

Although \(U_{xz}\neq U_{zx}\),

\[
U_{zx}=e^{A_x}U_{xz}e^{-A_x}.
\]

Thus they are similar and have the same trace, determinant, characteristic polynomial, and eigenvalue multiset.

Hence

\[
\boxed{\text{principal spectrum alone does not recover path order}.}
\]

The ordered segment word and commutator-curvature memory must remain part of the represented state.

## 4. Small-square curvature theorem

For

\[
U_\square(\varepsilon)
=e^{\varepsilon A_z}e^{\varepsilon A_x}
 e^{-\varepsilon A_z}e^{-\varepsilon A_x},
\]

Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion gives

\[
\boxed{
U_\square(\varepsilon)
=I+\varepsilon^2[A_z,A_x]+O(\varepsilon^3).
}
\]

The first order-sensitive residue of the ordered square is therefore the commutator curvature.

## 5. Common-commutant irreducibility theorem

For a star-closed finite operator family \(\mathcal F\subset M_2(\mathbb C)\), define

\[
\mathcal F'=\{X:XA=AX\text{ for every }A\in\mathcal F\}.
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{
\mathcal F\text{ acts irreducibly}
\iff
\mathcal F'=\mathbb C I.
}
\]

A single-axis family has a two-dimensional commutant and is reducible. The two-axis \(x/z\) Pauli family has scalar commutant and is irreducible.

The verdict is invariant under constant \(SU(2)\) gauge conjugation.

## 6. Three distinct notions

The source proves that the following must not be conflated:

\[
\text{representation irreducibility}
\neq
\text{composition-primitivity}
\neq
\text{arithmetic primality}.
\]

Each requires a separate theorem and a separate category of admissible decompositions.

## 7. Nonmultiplicativity of local factors

For a supplied positive length,

\[
Z_C(s)=\det(I-e^{-s\ell_C}U_C)^{-1}.
\]

For noncommuting segments, the composed factor does not generally satisfy

\[
Z_{C_2\star C_1}=Z_{C_2}Z_{C_1}.
\]

Path ordering is therefore load-bearing data rather than cosmetic notation.
