# Recognition-Complete Finite-to-Infinite Cut Theorem

## 1. Purpose

This theorem is the generalized bridge needed before any RH specialization.
It replaces the vague instruction

```text
refine the finite model and take a limit
```

by a clock-free recognition-completion theorem.

The refinement index is a directed comparison label, not time.  Every packet is
first transported to a common recovered carrier.  Convergence is required in
both the recognized and cut-memory channels, with predeclared Smriti tails.

---

## 2. Transported finite cut packets

Let \(\mathcal D\) be a common algebraic source core.  After recovered middle
identification, let every finite packet be represented on one complete event
carrier \(\mathcal K\) by a bounded lift

\[
Z_n:\mathcal D\longrightarrow\mathcal K.
\]

Let

\[
P_n=P_n^*=P_n^2,
\qquad
Q_n=I-P_n.
\]

Define the recognized and memory lifts

\[
Y_n=P_nZ_n,
\qquad
M_n=Q_nZ_n.
\]

The finite positive forms are

\[
R_n=Y_n^*Y_n,
\qquad
D_n=M_n^*M_n,
\]

and the finite signed cut form is

\[
F_n=R_n-D_n.
\]

The notation \(^*\) is used only after the positive recognition form has been
quotiented by its null seam and completed.  The Hilbert representation is thus
derived, not primitive.

---

## 3. Recognition-Cauchy hypothesis

### Definition 3.1

The transported cut packets are recognition-Cauchy when there exist numbers

\[
\rho_n^{\rm rec},
\qquad
\rho_n^{\rm mem},
\qquad
\rho_n^{\rm hol}
\]

with

\[
\rho_n^{\rm rec}+\rho_n^{\rm mem}+\rho_n^{\rm hol}
\longrightarrow0
\]

such that, for all sufficiently refined \(m\succeq n\),

\[
\|Y_m-Y_n\|
\le \rho_n^{\rm rec},
\]

\[
\|M_m-M_n\|
\le \rho_n^{\rm mem},
\]

and the recovered-middle path holonomy/residue between the two transported
packets is bounded by \(\rho_n^{\rm hol}\).

The comparison is invalid if the source metric, cut labels or memory orientation
have been changed without a recovered identity map.

---

## 4. Smriti tail hypothesis

For each \(n\), let \(C_n^{\rm rec}\), \(C_n^{\rm mem}\) be predeclared
corrections and let \(\mathsf S_n^{\rm rec}\), \(\mathsf S_n^{\rm mem}\) be
lawful tail memories satisfying

\[
Y=
Y_n+C_n^{\rm rec}+\mathsf S_n^{\rm rec},
\]

\[
M=
M_n+C_n^{\rm mem}+\mathsf S_n^{\rm mem},
\]

with

\[
\|\mathsf S_n^{\rm rec}\|
+\|\mathsf S_n^{\rm mem}\|
\longrightarrow0.
\]

The corrections must be generated from constitutive, analytic or reference data
independent of the held-out evaluation residue.

This is the operator form of

```text
finite Chandas recursion + correction + vanishing Smriti tail.
```

---

## 5. Recognition-complete limit

### Theorem 5.1 (Cut-channel completion)

Under the recognition-Cauchy and Smriti-tail hypotheses, there exist bounded
limit lifts

\[
Y,M:\mathcal H_{\rm rec}\longrightarrow\mathcal K
\]

such that

\[
Y_n\longrightarrow Y,
\qquad
M_n\longrightarrow M
\]

in operator norm after declared corrections.  The limit event lift is

\[
Z=Y+M.
\]

The cut-generated forms

\[
R=Y^*Y,
\qquad
D=M^*M,
\qquad
F=R-D
\]

satisfy

\[
R_n\longrightarrow R,
\qquad
D_n\longrightarrow D,
\qquad
F_n\longrightarrow F
\]

in operator norm.

#### Proof

The two channel families are Cauchy in the complete operator spaces and therefore
converge.  For any two bounded operators \(A,B\),

\[
\|A^*A-B^*B\|
\le
(\|A\|+\|B\|)\|A-B\|.
\]

Apply this first to \(Y_n,Y\) and then to \(M_n,M\).  Subtraction gives the
convergence of \(F_n\).  The holonomy condition ensures that the limits belong
to one recovered carrier rather than merely sharing a shadow coordinate. ∎

### Quantitative form

If

\[
\delta_n^{\rm rec}=\|Y-Y_n\|,
\qquad
\delta_n^{\rm mem}=\|M-M_n\|,
\]

then

\[
\boxed{
\|R-R_n\|
\le
(\|Y\|+\|Y_n\|)\delta_n^{\rm rec},
}
\]

\[
\boxed{
\|D-D_n\|
\le
(\|M\|+\|M_n\|)\delta_n^{\rm mem},
}
\]

and

\[
\boxed{
\|F-F_n\|
\le
(\|Y\|+\|Y_n\|)\delta_n^{\rm rec}
+
(\|M\|+\|M_n\|)\delta_n^{\rm mem}.
}
\]

These bounds are the general replacement for an unnamed collection of finite-to-
infinite errors.

## 6. Target-faithful memory completion

Let

\[
T_n:\mathcal K\longrightarrow\mathbb C^\nu,
\qquad \nu\le5,
\]

be transported target observers satisfying

\[
T_nT_n^*=I_\nu.
\]

Define the faithfulness residual

\[
\varepsilon_n^{\rm faith}
=
\|(I-T_n^*T_n)M_n\|.
\]

Assume

\[
T_n\longrightarrow T
\]

in operator norm after one fixed label orientation, and

\[
\varepsilon_n^{\rm faith}\longrightarrow0.
\]

### Theorem 6.1 (No-hidden-memory completion)

The limit memory lift satisfies

\[
\boxed{
M=T^*TM.
}
\]

Consequently

\[
\overline{\operatorname{Ran}M}
\subseteq
\operatorname{Ran}T^*,
\]

and the target-relevant memory rank is at most \(\nu\le5\).

#### Proof

Write

\[
(I-T^*T)M
=
(I-T^*T)(M-M_n)
+
(T_n^*T_n-T^*T)M_n
+
(I-T_n^*T_n)M_n.
\]

Every term tends to zero by norm convergence and the faithfulness residual. ∎

This is the rigorous no-hidden-complement theorem.  A numerically rank-five
finite packet without the vanishing faithfulness residual does not satisfy it.

---

## 7. Cut-derived finite seam matrix

Define

\[
A_n=T_nM_n,
\qquad
A=TM.
\]

Then

\[
D_n=A_n^*A_n+E_n^{\rm blind},
\qquad
\|E_n^{\rm blind}\|\longrightarrow0,
\]

and in the limit

\[
D=A^*A.
\]

Assume a uniform positive reference floor

\[
R_n\ge mI,
\qquad
R\ge mI,
\qquad m>0.
\]

Define

\[
B_n=A_nR_n^{-1}A_n^*
\in M_\nu(\mathbb C),
\]

and

\[
B=AR^{-1}A^*.
\]

### Theorem 7.1 (Finite seam-matrix convergence)

The matrices satisfy

\[
B_n\longrightarrow B
\]

in operator norm.  More precisely,

\[
\boxed{
\|B_n-B\|
\le
m^{-1}(\|A_n\|+\|A\|)\|A_n-A\|
+
m^{-2}\|A\|\|A_n\|\|R_n-R\|.
}
\]

#### Proof

Use

\[
\|R_n^{-1}\|,\|R^{-1}\|\le m^{-1}
\]

and

\[
\|R_n^{-1}-R^{-1}\|
\le
m^{-2}\|R_n-R\|.
\]

Expand \(B_n-B\) by adding and subtracting
\(AR_n^{-1}A_n^*\) and \(AR^{-1}A_n^*\). ∎

---

## 8. Exact infinite-to-finite conclusion

By Theorem 6.1,

\[
F=R-A^*A.
\]

The cut-memory spectral isomorphism therefore gives

\[
\boxed{
N_-(F)=N_+(B-I),
}
\]

\[
\boxed{
\dim\ker F=\dim\ker(I-B),
}
\]

and

\[
\boxed{
\inf_{f\ne0}
\frac{\langle f,Ff\rangle}{\langle f,Rf\rangle}
=
\lambda_{\min}(I-B).
}
\]

Thus the infinite signed cut form is decided by a matrix of size at most five,
but only after recognition-complete convergence and target faithfulness have
been proved.

---

## 9. Outward finite certificate

Let \(u_n\) be an outward upper bound for \(\lambda_{\max}(B_n)\), and let
\(e_n\) be an outward upper bound for \(\|B-B_n\|\).  Then

\[
\lambda_{\max}(B)
\le u_n+e_n.
\]

Hence

\[
\boxed{
u_n+e_n<1}
\]

is a lawful finite certificate for

\[
F>0
\]

in the reference metric.

A fixed-grid top without \(e_n\) is a shadow certificate only.

---

## 10. Why this theorem is clock-free

No external time parameter appears.  The index \(n\) labels a directed
refinement or declared comparison object.  The calculus uses:

```text
trans-cut arrows;
recovered middle identity;
recognition-Cauchy comparison;
predeclared Smriti tails;
target-faithful memory observers.
```

An exponential family may generate one refinement chart, but the theorem does
not depend on that chart.

---

## 11. RH specialization gate

For the completed-Weil specialization, the framework must construct a directed
family of native event lifts

\[
Z_n^{\rm Weil}
\]

from prime, Gamma, completion-boundary and compatibility events and prove:

```text
1. recovered identity across all refinement arrows;
2. recognized and memory channel Cauchy bounds;
3. Madhava--Smriti tail bounds for every omitted event family;
4. target-faithfulness residual -> 0 with one fixed five-label orientation;
5. a uniform positive recognized-reference floor;
6. an outward finite seam-matrix margin.
```

Only then is RH a special case of the universal Recognition-Complete Cut
Theorem.
