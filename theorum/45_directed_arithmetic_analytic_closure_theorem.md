# Directed Arithmetic-Analytic Closure Theorem

## 1. Purpose and source lineage

This theorem closes a gap left intentionally separate in the earlier flow and
completion results: analytic truncation error and machine-arithmetic error are
not the same object and must not be merged into one optimistic decimal.

The construction consumes four already present ingredients:

```text
Vedic Bhinna exact ratio / remainder discipline
Vedic Madhava-Yuktibhasha corrected-tail grammar
Theorem 43 observed-flow jet remainder
Theorem 44 corrected body-tail transfer
Theorem 28 finite-to-infinite outward completion
NUMERICAL_PROOF_PROTOCOL exact / interval / ball arithmetic rule
```

The Vedic source is used structurally: finite decimals and rational relations
have an exact ratio carrier, while correction and untraversed remainder remain
separate. The present theorem supplies the proof-bearing numerical layer needed
for arbitrary-precision and validated interval/ball implementations.

It does **not** assert that raw IEEE floating point becomes exact, that every
external numerical package is validated, or that a centre value without an
outward radius is proof-bearing.

## 2. Exact scalar carrier

Let \(\mathbb Q\) denote the exact rational carrier. Integers embed in the
usual way. A finite decimal token is interpreted before binary floating-point
conversion.

If the token has signed integer significand \(A\) and decimal scale \(m\),
then

\[
\boxed{x=\frac{A}{10^m}\in\mathbb Q.}
\tag{2.1}
\]

Scientific notation is absorbed into the power of ten before reduction.
Therefore, for example,

\[
0.1=\frac1{10},\qquad
0.7=\frac7{10},\qquad
0.8=\frac45,
\tag{2.2}
\]

and hence

\[
\boxed{0.1+0.7=0.8}
\tag{2.3}
\]

exactly in the declared-value carrier.

This is the Bhinna compatibility rule: decimal spelling and fractional form are
two presentations of one exact rational relation whenever the declared value is
a finite decimal.

---

## 3. Validated enclosure carrier

Let \(X\) be a normed vector space. A validated ball is

\[
\boxed{\mathbb B(c,\rho)=\{x\in X:\|x-c\|\le\rho\},\qquad \rho\ge0.}
\tag{3.1}
\]

An exact value embeds as a zero-radius ball,

\[
\boxed{\iota(x)=\mathbb B(x,0).}
\tag{3.2}
\]

Thus exact rational arithmetic and validated approximate arithmetic are not
competing systems. The former is the zero-error sector of the latter.

For ordered real scalars an interval \([a,b]\) is equivalent to the ball

\[
\mathbb B\!\left(\frac{a+b}{2},\frac{b-a}{2}\right).
\tag{3.3}
\]

A numerical backend is **validated for one result** only when it supplies an
outward enclosure known to contain the exact arithmetic target. A nearest-
rounded floating-point centre with no proved radius is not such an enclosure.

---

## 4. Arithmetic-analytic decomposition

Let \(F\in X\) be the exact target. Suppose an analytic refinement gives

\[
\boxed{F=M_r+T_r}
\tag{4.1}
\]

with a proved tail bound

\[
\boxed{\|T_r\|\le\tau_r.}
\tag{4.2}
\]

Theorem 43 supplies one such \(\tau_r\) for bounded exponential flow, while
Theorem 44 supplies the exact body-tail transfer under jet refinement.

Let a numerical backend at arithmetic precision label \(p\) return
\(\widehat M_{r,p}\) together with a proved outward arithmetic radius
\(\rho_{r,p}\) satisfying

\[
\boxed{\|M_r-\widehat M_{r,p}\|\le\rho_{r,p}.}
\tag{4.3}
\]

Define the typed arithmetic residue

\[
A_{r,p}:=M_r-\widehat M_{r,p}.
\tag{4.4}
\]

Then the exact closure identity is

\[
\boxed{F=\widehat M_{r,p}+A_{r,p}+T_r.}
\tag{4.5}
\]

### Theorem 4.1 (Total enclosure)

Under (4.1)--(4.3),

\[
\boxed{
\|F-\widehat M_{r,p}\|
\le
\rho_{r,p}+\tau_r.
}
\tag{4.6}
\]

#### Proof

From (4.5),

\[
F-\widehat M_{r,p}=A_{r,p}+T_r.
\]

Apply the triangle inequality and the two declared bounds. \(\square\)

The arithmetic radius and analytic tail are therefore distinct ledgers:

```text
arithmetic radius   = error introduced by numerical representation/operations;
analytic tail       = error from finite analytic/refinement depth.
```

Neither may be hidden inside the other.

---

## 5. Lawful correction / Madhava refinement

Suppose a predeclared lawful correction \(C_r\) gives

\[
\boxed{F=M_r+C_r+S_r}
\tag{5.1}
\]

with

\[
\|S_r\|\le\sigma_r.
\tag{5.2}
\]

Let the backend enclose the corrected body,

\[
\|M_r+C_r-\widehat N_{r,p}\|\le\rho_{r,p}.
\tag{5.3}
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{
\|F-\widehat N_{r,p}\|
\le
\rho_{r,p}+\sigma_r.
}
\tag{5.4}
\]

A correction is useful when it reduces the proved remaining tail, but it is not
licensed merely because it improves the displayed digits. This is the exact
numerical consumption of the Madhava-Smriti rule from Theorem 44.

---

## 6. Three-ledger refinement identity

At two refinement states write

\[
F=\widehat M_r+A_r+T_r
=\widehat M_{r+1}+A_{r+1}+T_{r+1}.
\tag{6.1}
\]

Subtracting gives

\[
\boxed{
(\widehat M_{r+1}-\widehat M_r)
+(A_{r+1}-A_r)
+(T_{r+1}-T_r)=0.
}
\tag{6.2}
\]

Thus every refinement increment is accounted for by three typed channels:

```text
computed-body increment
+ arithmetic-residue increment
+ analytic-tail increment
= 0.
```

When arithmetic is exact, \(A_r=0\). When the analytic representation terminates
exactly, \(T_r=0\). Exact finite proof is the simultaneous zero-radius / zero-tail
sector.

---

## 7. Directed precision-refinement convergence

Use the product refinement label

\[
(r,p),
\tag{7.1}
\]

where \(r\) is analytic depth and \(p\) is arithmetic precision. This is a
directed comparison label, not physical time.

### Theorem 7.1 (Arithmetic-analytic convergence)

Assume

\[
\tau_r\longrightarrow0
\tag{7.2}
\]

and choose a cofinal precision schedule \(p(r)\) such that

\[
\rho_{r,p(r)}\longrightarrow0.
\tag{7.3}
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{
\widehat M_{r,p(r)}\longrightarrow F.
}
\tag{7.4}
\]

#### Proof

Equation (4.6) gives

\[
\|F-\widehat M_{r,p(r)}\|
\le\rho_{r,p(r)}+\tau_r\to0.
\]

\(\square\)

If a fixed arithmetic backend has a nonvanishing radius floor, this theorem
does not claim convergence below that floor. More analytic terms cannot erase
an unresolved arithmetic enclosure.

---

## 8. Independent-path enclosure test

Suppose two independent validated computations for the same exact target satisfy

\[
F\in\mathbb B(c_1,\rho_1),
\qquad
F\in\mathbb B(c_2,\rho_2).
\tag{8.1}
\]

### Theorem 8.1 (Certified path-overlap necessity)

Then

\[
\boxed{\|c_1-c_2\|\le\rho_1+\rho_2.}
\tag{8.2}
\]

#### Proof

By the triangle inequality,

\[
\|c_1-c_2\|
\le\|c_1-F\|+\|F-c_2\|
\le\rho_1+\rho_2.
\]

\(\square\)

Therefore disjoint certified balls cannot both be valid certificates for the
same exact target. At least one target identity, adapter, or outward enclosure
must be wrong. This is the numerical specialization of path-equality testing.

---

## 9. Strict outward threshold promotion

Let \(x\in\mathbb R\) be the exact scalar quantity whose strict upper threshold
is \(\Theta\). Suppose a finite computation gives centre/upper surrogate \(u\),
arithmetic radius \(\rho\), and analytic tail \(\tau\), with the proved
consequence

\[
x\le u+\rho+\tau.
\tag{9.1}
\]

Then the lawful promotion rule is

\[
\boxed{u+\rho+\tau<\Theta.}
\tag{9.2}
\]

Equality is a boundary state, not a strict certificate:

\[
u+\rho+\tau=\Theta
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\text{no strict promotion}.
\tag{9.3}
\]

For Theorem 28's normalized seam matrix this becomes

\[
\boxed{u_n+e_n<1,}
\tag{9.4}
\]

where the completion error \(e_n\) may itself be decomposed into validated
arithmetic and analytic/refinement components.

## 10. Backend classes

The theorem licenses the following proof roles:

```text
EXACT_INTEGER / EXACT_RATIONAL
    arithmetic radius rho = 0;

EXACT_FINITE_DECIMAL
    canonicalized to an exact rational before binary floating conversion;

DIRECTED_INTERVAL / VALIDATED_BALL
    backend supplies a proved outward enclosure;

VALIDATED_LINEAR_ALGEBRA
    solver residuals and conditioning/rounding propagation are included outward;

RAW_NEAREST_FLOAT
    centre/calibration only unless a separate proved outward radius is supplied.
```

An implementation may promote from exact rational to validated ball arithmetic
when exact numerator/denominator growth becomes computationally inefficient.
That promotion is an embedding into a larger certified carrier, not a loss of
proof discipline.

---

## 11. Exact finite certificate

The accompanying proof packet uses only `fractions.Fraction` plus exact decimal
token conversion through `decimal.Decimal`. It verifies:

```text
0.1 + 0.7 = 0.8 exactly in the declared-value carrier;
exact rational -> zero-radius ball embedding;
strict / boundary / failed outward threshold cases;
raw float without a radius classified non-proof-bearing;
independent-ball overlap necessity and disjoint negative control;
three-ledger refinement identity;
arithmetic-radius + analytic-tail addition;
correction-tail reduction fixture;
directed total-error descent fixture;
interval/ball compatibility;
exact Bhinna-style rational representation.
```

No NumPy, binary floating-point proof margin, fitted tolerance, or post-hoc
correction is used by the certificate.

Expected status:

```text
PASS_DIRECTED_ARITHMETIC_ANALYTIC_CLOSURE_CANDIDATE
```
