# Odd Native-to-Classical Completed-Weil Normalization Interface

## 1. Purpose

Stages 3F and 3G close the native odd sign on the Recognition-Seam carrier:

\[
\ker S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}=\{0\},
\]

and

\[
\langle f,W_3^-f\rangle
\ge
0.1709143798342551
\langle f,S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}f\rangle
>0
\]

for every nonzero odd native state.

The remaining interface is not another sign estimate. It is a normalization
theorem: the native boundary, Gamma and prime-power terms must be shown to be
exactly the completed explicit-formula distribution evaluated on one declared
correlation, in one Fourier convention, on one logarithmic test core.

The order is

```text
native logarithmic core
-> correlation q_(f,h)=f*h-sharp
-> completed explicit-formula distribution E_xi(q_(f,h))
-> termwise boundary/Gamma/prime identity
-> odd negative-rank-one restriction
-> multiplicative/logarithmic unitary identity
-> classical symmetric-zero-sum membrane.
```

The last arrow is a classical theorem. Stage 3H pins it but does not pretend to
rederive it from the preceding algebra.

## 2. Pinned conventions

Throughout, Hilbert inner products are linear in the first variable.

Let

\[
\mathcal D=C_c^\infty(\mathbb R),
\qquad
\mathcal D_\times=C_c^\infty(0,\infty).
\]

Use the Fourier convention

\[
\boxed{
\widehat f(z)
=\int_{\mathbb R}f(x)e^{izx}\,dx,
}
\tag{2.1}
\]

with

\[
\|f\|_2^2
=\frac1{2\pi}\int_{\mathbb R}|\widehat f(\xi)|^2\,d\xi.
\]

Define translation and the reflection-adjoint by

\[
(T_th)(x)=h(x-t),
\qquad
h^\sharp(x)=\overline{h(-x)}.
\tag{2.2}
\]

For \(f,h\in\mathcal D\), put

\[
\boxed{
q_{f,h}=f*h^\sharp.
}
\tag{2.3}
\]

Because \(f\) and \(h\) are compactly supported, \(q_{f,h}\) is compactly
supported and its Fourier transform is entire.

---

## 3. Correlation theorem

### Theorem 3.1

For every real \(t\),

\[
\boxed{
q_{f,h}(t)=\langle f,T_th\rangle_{L^2}.
}
\tag{3.1}
\]

For every \(z\in\mathbb C\),

\[
\boxed{
\widehat q_{f,h}(z)
=
\widehat f(z)
\overline{\widehat h(\overline z)}.
}
\tag{3.2}
\]

#### Proof

By definition,

\[
\begin{aligned}
q_{f,h}(t)
&=\int_{\mathbb R}f(x)h^\sharp(t-x)\,dx\\
&=\int_{\mathbb R}f(x)\overline{h(x-t)}\,dx\\
&=\langle f,T_th\rangle.
\end{aligned}
\]

The convolution theorem gives

\[
\widehat q_{f,h}(z)
=\widehat f(z)\widehat{h^\sharp}(z).
\]

Changing variables in the second factor yields

\[
\widehat{h^\sharp}(z)
=\overline{\widehat h(\overline z)}.
\]

This proves both identities. ∎

The conjugate-reflection in (3.2) is essential away from the real axis. Omitting
it changes the completion-boundary term and destroys the Hermitian interface.

---

## 4. The pinned completed explicit-formula distribution

Let

\[
G(\xi)
=
\operatorname{Re}\psi\!\left(\frac14+\frac{i\xi}{2}\right)
-\log\pi.
\tag{4.1}
\]

For a compactly supported smooth correlation \(q\), define the completed
boundary--Gamma--prime distribution side by

\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal E_\xi(q)
={}&\widehat q(i/2)+\widehat q(-i/2)\\
&+\frac1{2\pi}\int_{\mathbb R}G(\xi)\widehat q(\xi)\,d\xi\\
&-\sum_{n\ge2}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{\sqrt n}
\bigl(q(\log n)+q(-\log n)\bigr).
\end{aligned}
}
\tag{4.2}
\]

Only finitely many prime-power translations meet the compact support of \(q\).
The formula therefore has no hidden truncation on the core.

The classical completed explicit formula, in the normalization of

\[
\xi(s)
=\frac12s(s-1)\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)\zeta(s),
\]

identifies (4.2) with the symmetrically summed zero distribution. That theorem
is consumed later as a classical membrane; it is not derived in Stage 3H.

---

## 5. Termwise normalization theorem

For \(f,h\in\mathcal D\), define

\[
\ell_+(f)=\widehat f(i/2),
\qquad
\ell_-(f)=\widehat f(-i/2),
\tag{5.1}
\]

\[
B(f,h)
=
\ell_+(f)\overline{\ell_-(h)}
+
\ell_-(f)\overline{\ell_+(h)},
\tag{5.2}
\]

\[
A_\Gamma(f,h)
=
\frac1{2\pi}
\int_{\mathbb R}
G(\xi)\widehat f(\xi)
\overline{\widehat h(\xi)}\,d\xi,
\tag{5.3}
\]

and

\[
P_{1/2}(f,h)
=
\sum_{n\ge2}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{\sqrt n}
\left(
\langle f,T_{\log n}h\rangle
+
\langle f,T_{-\log n}h\rangle
\right).
\tag{5.4}
\]

The native logarithmic completed-Weil form is

\[
W_\xi(f,h)=B(f,h)+A_\Gamma(f,h)-P_{1/2}(f,h).
\tag{5.5}
\]

### Theorem 5.1 (Exact native/classical distribution interface)

For every \(f,h\in\mathcal D\),

\[
\boxed{
W_\xi(f,h)=\mathcal E_\xi(q_{f,h}).
}
\tag{5.6}
\]

#### Proof

By Theorem 3.1,

\[
\widehat q_{f,h}(i/2)
=
\ell_+(f)\overline{\ell_-(h)},
\]

and

\[
\widehat q_{f,h}(-i/2)
=
\ell_-(f)\overline{\ell_+(h)}.
\]

These are exactly the two terms in (5.2).

For real \(\xi\), (3.2) reduces to

\[
\widehat q_{f,h}(\xi)
=\widehat f(\xi)\overline{\widehat h(\xi)},
\]

which turns the integral in (4.2) into (5.3).

Finally, (3.1) gives

\[
q_{f,h}(\pm\log n)
=\langle f,T_{\pm\log n}h\rangle,
\]

which turns the prime-power sum in (4.2) into (5.4). Adding the three identities
proves (5.6). ∎

No factor, sign, conjugation or \(2\pi\) normalization remains implicit.

---

## 6. Hermitian and reflection covariance

The correlation satisfies

\[
q_{h,f}(t)=\overline{q_{f,h}(-t)}.
\tag{6.1}
\]

Because \(G\) is real and even and the prime translations occur in \(\pm\) pairs,

\[
\mathcal E_\xi(q_{h,f})
=
\overline{\mathcal E_\xi(q_{f,h})}.
\tag{6.2}
\]

Thus (5.6) is Hermitian.

Let

\[
(\kappa f)(x)=f(-x).
\]

Then

\[
q_{\kappa f,\kappa h}(t)=q_{f,h}(-t),
\]

so

\[
\boxed{
W_\xi(\kappa f,\kappa h)=W_\xi(f,h).
}
\tag{6.3}
\]

This is the core identity from which the completed even/odd decomposition is
derived.

---

## 7. Exact odd restriction

Let

\[
\mathcal D^-
=
\{f\in C_c^\infty(\mathbb R):f(-x)=-f(x)\}.
\]

For \(f\in\mathcal D^-\),

\[
\widehat f(-z)=-\widehat f(z),
\]

and hence

\[
\ell_-(f)=-\ell_+(f).
\tag{7.1}
\]

Define

\[
L_\partial f=\sqrt2\,\ell_+(f).
\tag{7.2}
\]

### Theorem 7.1 (Odd negative-rank-one normalization)

For \(f,h\in\mathcal D^-\),

\[
\boxed{
B(f,h)
=-L_\partial(f)\overline{L_\partial(h)}.
}
\tag{7.3}
\]

Consequently,

\[
\boxed{
W_\xi^-(f,h)
=
A_\Gamma(f,h)-P_{1/2}(f,h)
-L_\partial(f)\overline{L_\partial(h)}.
}
\tag{7.4}
\]

#### Proof

Substitute (7.1) into (5.2):

\[
\begin{aligned}
B(f,h)
&=\ell_+(f)\overline{-\ell_+(h)}
+(-\ell_+(f))\overline{\ell_+(h)}\\
&=-2\ell_+(f)\overline{\ell_+(h)}.
\end{aligned}
\]

Equation (7.2) gives (7.3), and (7.4) follows from (5.5). ∎

This is the exact classical normalization of the native Stage 3F decomposition

\[
W_3^-=S_{0,-}^{\mathrm{full}}-L_\partial^*L_\partial.
\]

---

## 8. Multiplicative/logarithmic unitary interface

For \(F\in\mathcal D_\times\), define

\[
(\mathcal LF)(x)=F(e^x).
\tag{8.1}
\]

Since \(dr/r=dx\), \(\mathcal L\) is the core Haar isometry. Under the Mellin
convention

\[
(\mathcal MF)(\xi)
=\int_0^\infty F(r)r^{-i\xi}\,\frac{dr}{r},
\]

one has

\[
\boxed{
\mathcal MF(\xi)=\widehat{\mathcal LF}(-\xi).
}
\tag{8.2}
\]

The multiplicative boundary channels satisfy

\[
\ell_+^\times(F)=\ell_+(\mathcal LF),
\qquad
\ell_-^\times(F)=\ell_-(\mathcal LF).
\tag{8.3}
\]

For the scale flow

\[
(U_tF)(r)=F(e^{-t}r),
\]

one has

\[
\boxed{
\mathcal L U_t=T_t\mathcal L.
}
\tag{8.4}
\]

Finally,

\[
\mathcal LJ_\times=\kappa\mathcal L.
\tag{8.5}
\]

### Theorem 8.1

For \(F,H\in\mathcal D_\times\),

\[
\boxed{
W_\times(F,H)
=W_\xi(\mathcal LF,\mathcal LH).
}
\tag{8.6}
\]

#### Proof

Equation (8.3) matches the boundary terms. Equation (8.2), followed by
\(\xi\mapsto-\xi\), matches the Gamma terms because \(G\) is even. Equation
(8.4) matches every paired prime dilation with its logarithmic translation.
Adding the three identities gives (8.6). ∎

Thus the multiplicative inversion-odd core and the logarithmic odd core are the
same test object in unitary charts.

---

## 9. Fourier-sign convention invariance

If the opposite Fourier convention is used,

\[
\mathcal F_-f(\xi)
=\int f(x)e^{-i\xi x}\,dx
=\widehat f(-\xi),
\]

then:

```text
the two boundary values are interchanged;
the Gamma integral is unchanged because G is even;
the prime translations are interchanged inside each +/- pair.
```

Therefore the completed Hermitian form is unchanged. The sign of the Fourier
exponent is a chart orientation, not a new quadratic form.

---

## 10. Core density and extension

The logarithmic map is a bijection

\[
\mathcal L:\mathcal D_\times\longrightarrow\mathcal D.
\]

It maps inversion-odd functions to reflection-odd functions. The source carrier
theorem gives

\[
X_3^-=\overline{\mathcal D^-}^{\,X_3}.
\]

The native boundary, Gamma and prime forms are bounded in the native norm.
Therefore the termwise identity (5.6), the odd identity (7.4), and the unitary
identity (8.6) extend uniquely from the core to the native odd completion.

The classical zero-sum distribution is still consumed on the admissible core.
No assertion that the zero sum independently defines the completed Hilbert
operator is needed.

---

## 11. Classical membrane

Put

\[
z_\rho=\frac{\rho-1/2}{i}.
\]

The classical completed explicit formula in the pinned normalization states

\[
\boxed{
\mathcal E_\xi(q)
=\operatorname*{sym}\sum_\rho\widehat q(z_\rho).
}
\tag{11.1}
\]

Combining (11.1) with Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 5.1 gives

\[
\boxed{
W_\xi(f,h)
=
\operatorname*{sym}\sum_\rho
\widehat f(z_\rho)
\overline{\widehat h(\overline{z_\rho})}.
}
\tag{11.2}
\]

Stage 3H proves every normalization arrow entering (11.1). It does not claim a
new proof of the classical explicit formula itself.

---

## 12. Executable exact packet

The Stage 3H packet uses Gaussian rational Laurent sequences to verify exactly:

```text
q=f*h-sharp;
q(t)=<f,T_t h>;
q-hat(z)=f-hat(z) conjugate(h-hat(conjugate z));
boundary distribution = native boundary form;
Gamma distribution = native Gamma form;
prime distribution = paired translation form;
odd boundary = -L_partial*L_partial;
Mellin sign reversal is removed by the even Gamma symbol;
reflection, Hermitian symmetry and Fourier-sign invariance;
finite odd cores converge in a weighted completion.
```

The calibration is not a substitute for the analytic proof. It is a deterministic
normalization audit designed to catch missing conjugates, swapped pole channels,
incorrect translation signs and lost \(2\pi\) factors.
