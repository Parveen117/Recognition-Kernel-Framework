# Source-Bound Proof-Carrying Numerical Validation Theorem

## 1. Purpose and claim boundary

Theorem 45 proves how a certified arithmetic radius and a certified analytic tail compose. It does **not** prove that a participant-supplied radius or tail is true merely because it is present in a certificate. Theorem 46 likewise permits an approximate seam quotient only after its remainder and denominator-separation hypotheses are proved.

This theorem closes that trust membrane for a declared class of proof-carrying numerical certificates.

The principle is:

```text
A numerical bound may be consumed only after its source and derivation are validated.
A bound does not validate itself.
```

The theorem consumes the earlier chain

```text
Theorem 34  common-chart source binding and decoder transfer
Theorem 38  source-relative domination / form-range control
Theorem 39  no-blindness requirement
Theorem 43  explicit analytic remainder
Theorem 44  body-tail preservation under refinement
Theorem 45  arithmetic-radius + analytic-tail closure
Theorem 46  quantitative seam quotient after validated remainders
```

It does not claim universal validation of arbitrary external software, measurements, hardware, interval libraries, or participant assertions. Such objects require an admitted source validator.

## 2. Rational interval carrier

Let

\[
\mathbb I_{\mathbb Q}
=
\{[a,b]:a,b\in\mathbb Q,\ a\le b\}.
\]

For an interval \(I=[a,b]\), write

\[
\underline I=a,
\qquad
\overline I=b.
\]

An exact rational \(q\) embeds as the singleton

\[
\boxed{q\mapsto[q,q].}
\tag{2.1}
\]

The admitted exact interval operations are

\[
[a,b]+[c,d]=[a+c,b+d],
\tag{2.2}
\]

\[
[a,b]-[c,d]=[a-d,b-c],
\tag{2.3}
\]

\[
[a,b][c,d]
=
[\min(ac,ad,bc,bd),\max(ac,ad,bc,bd)],
\tag{2.4}
\]

and

\[
-[a,b]=[-b,-a].
\tag{2.5}
\]

For division, if

\[
0\notin[c,d],
\tag{2.6}
\]

then reciprocal endpoint order is taken outward and multiplication uses (2.4). If

\[
0\in[c,d],
\]

the division rule is not admitted.

All calculations in this carrier may be performed by exact integer/rational arithmetic.

---

## 3. Source-bound proof DAG

A **proof-carrying arithmetic trace** is a finite directed acyclic graph

\[
\mathcal G=(V,E)
\]

with a distinguished root \(r\). Each node \(v\in V\) has:

1. a unique identifier;
2. either a source-leaf declaration or an admitted operation;
3. an interval \(I_v\in\mathbb I_{\mathbb Q}\);
4. ordered references to its dependency nodes.

A source-leaf declaration has a source class \(s(v)\) and is accepted only when an admitted validator \(V_{s(v)}\) proves

\[
\boxed{x_v\in I_v.}
\tag{3.1}
\]

The initial exact-contract source class is the singleton case

\[
I_v=[q,q]
\]

for a rational value frozen as part of the mathematical challenge contract. External measurements, backend-produced radii, norm claims, or other nonprimitive assertions are not exact-contract leaves merely because their JSON encoding is exact.

For an internal node with operation \(f_v\) and dependency intervals \(I_{v_1},\ldots,I_{v_m}\), let

\[
\mathcal E_{f_v}(I_{v_1},\ldots,I_{v_m})
\]

be the canonical outward interval obtained from the admitted rules (2.2)--(2.6). The local verifier accepts only if

\[
\boxed{
\mathcal E_{f_v}(I_{v_1},\ldots,I_{v_m})\subseteq I_v.
}
\tag{3.2}
\]

Thus a participant may widen an enclosure, but cannot obtain certification by shrinking it below the verifier-computed enclosure.

### Theorem 3.1 (Source-bound DAG enclosure)

Assume:

- the graph is finite and acyclic;
- every dependency reference resolves to a unique earlier node in a topological order;
- every source leaf satisfies its admitted source validator;
- every internal node satisfies (3.2).

Then the exact value represented by every node lies in its declared interval. In particular,

\[
\boxed{x_r\in I_r.}
\tag{3.3}
\]

#### Proof

Take a topological ordering of the DAG. For a source leaf the claim is (3.1). Assume it holds for all dependencies of an internal node \(v\). Soundness of the admitted interval operation gives

\[
f_v(x_{v_1},\ldots,x_{v_m})
\in
\mathcal E_{f_v}(I_{v_1},\ldots,I_{v_m}).
\]

By (3.2), the latter is contained in \(I_v\). Induction over the topological order proves the result. \(\square\)

### Corollary 3.2 (Derived arithmetic radius)

For

\[
I_r=[L,U],
\]

define

\[
c=\frac{L+U}{2},
\qquad
\rho=\frac{U-L}{2}.
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{|x_r-c|\le\rho.}
\tag{3.4}
\]

The radius is derived from the verified trace. It is not a free participant assertion.

## 4. Source completeness / no-blindness boundary

Theorem 3.1 proves the arithmetic consequence of the declared dependency graph. It cannot prove that an omitted physical, semantic, or analytic dependency never mattered.

Therefore a proof-carrying trace is promotion-capable only when the selected adapter also closes a source-completeness obligation:

\[
\boxed{
V_{\mathrm{src}}=1
\Longrightarrow
\text{all target-relevant primitive inputs are represented by admitted leaves.}
}
\tag{4.1}
\]

This is the numerical analogue of the common-chart/no-blindness discipline in Theorems 34, 38 and 39. A beautifully verified DAG of the wrong source does not certify the target.

---

## 5. Theorem-derived analytic tails

A tail certificate must identify an admitted tail rule and supply the hypotheses from source-validated or DAG-derived quantities. The verifier recomputes the tail; the participant does not choose its final value.

### 5.1 Geometrically dominated tail

Suppose a series tail has magnitude terms satisfying, for \(k\ge N+1\),

\[
|a_{k+1}|\le q|a_k|,
\qquad
0\le q<1.
\tag{5.1}
\]

If the first omitted magnitude obeys

\[
|a_{N+1}|\le A,
\]

then

\[
\boxed{
\left|\sum_{k=N+1}^{\infty}a_k\right|
\le
\frac{A}{1-q}.
}
\tag{5.2}
\]

### 5.2 Rational upper enclosure for the exponential

Let \(x\in\mathbb Q_{\ge0}\), and choose \(m\ge0\) so that

\[
q_m=\frac{x}{m+2}<1.
\tag{5.3}
\]

Since the ratio between successive exponential-series terms beyond order \(m+1\) is at most \(q_m\),

\[
\boxed{
e^x
\le
E_m(x)
:=
\sum_{k=0}^{m}\frac{x^k}{k!}
+
\frac{x^{m+1}}{(m+1)!}
\frac{1}{1-x/(m+2)}.
}
\tag{5.4}
\]

Every quantity on the right is rational.

### 5.3 Theorem-43 jet tail without floating-point exponentiation

Let source-validated quantities satisfy

\[
|t|\le T,
\qquad
\|B\|\le B_*,
\qquad
\|G\|\le G_*,
\]

with \(T,B_*,G_*\in\mathbb Q_{\ge0}\). Theorem 43 gives

\[
\|R_{N+1}(t)\|
\le
\frac{T^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}
B_*G_*^{N+1}e^{TG_*}.
\]

Choose \(m\) satisfying

\[
\frac{TG_*}{m+2}<1.
\]

Using (5.4), the verifier may compute the exact rational upper bound

\[
\boxed{
\tau_{43}
=
\frac{T^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}
B_*G_*^{N+1}E_m(TG_*).
}
\tag{5.5}
\]

No nearest-rounded evaluation of \(e^{TG_*}\) is required.

### Theorem 5.1 (Tail-source rule)

If every hypothesis of an admitted tail rule is source-validated or DAG-derived and the verifier recomputes \(\tau\) from that rule, then the resulting tail bound is proof-bearing. A participant-supplied scalar named `analytic_tail` without such provenance is not proof-bearing.

---

## 6. Source-bound numerical promotion

Let \(\widehat M\) be the numerical center obtained from a source-bound arithmetic certificate and let

\[
\|M-\widehat M\|\le\rho
\tag{6.1}
\]

be derived from Theorem 3.1. Let an admitted tail rule prove

\[
\|T\|\le\tau.
\tag{6.2}
\]

By Theorem 45,

\[
F=\widehat M+A+T,
\qquad
\|A\|\le\rho,
\]

therefore

\[
\boxed{
\|F-\widehat M\|
\le
\rho+\tau.
}
\tag{6.3}
\]

### Theorem 6.1 (Source-bound promotion gate)

Let

\[
V_\rho=1
\]

mean the arithmetic trace and its source leaves have passed, and let

\[
V_\tau=1
\]

mean the analytic tail rule and its hypotheses have passed. A strict upper-threshold promotion may occur only when

\[
\boxed{
V_\rho=1,
\qquad
V_\tau=1,
\qquad
U+\tau<\Theta,
}
\tag{6.4}
\]

where \(U=\overline I_r\).

If either validator is open, absent, unsupported, or fails, the bound cannot be promoted merely because the participant supplied numerically favorable values.

---

## 7. Certainty-aware strict boundary

For a strict claim

\[
F<\Theta,
\]

let the final certified scalar enclosure be \([L,U]\), after all proof-bearing arithmetic and analytic uncertainty has been carried outward.

The terminal logic is:

\[
\boxed{
\begin{array}{ll}
U<\Theta
& \text{PASS},\\[2mm]
L=U=\Theta
& \text{FAIL (exact strict inequality is false)},\\[2mm]
U=\Theta\text{ and }L<U
& \text{INCOMPLETE (refinement may decide)},\\[2mm]
L\ge\Theta
& \text{FAIL},\\[2mm]
L<\Theta<U
& \text{INCOMPLETE}.
\end{array}
}
\tag{7.1}
\]

This distinguishes mathematical falsity from unresolved numerical contact with a boundary.

---

## 8. Implementation commitment boundary

A proof-carrying protocol must commit the validator semantics used to interpret the certificate. Let

\[
H_{\mathrm{impl}}
\]

be a cryptographic digest of a declared implementation manifest containing the validator source, parser contract, schema and admitted operation/tail-rule identifiers.

The challenge rules should commit

\[
\boxed{H_{\mathrm{impl}}}
\tag{8.1}
\]

so an implementation change cannot masquerade as the same frozen protocol.

This is an **integrity** statement, not an external authenticity theorem. If an attacker controls both the executable and the hash it reports, an internal hash is not a trust anchor. A published repository commit, immutable archive, signature, attestation, or equivalent external pin is still required when executable authenticity matters.

---

## 9. Negative controls

A compliant verifier must reject or hold open at least the following:

```text
cycle in proof DAG                              INVALID
missing dependency                             INVALID
duplicate node identifier                      INVALID
claimed node interval narrower than recompute  FAILED
interval division with zero in denominator     FAILED / INVALID
participant radius without proof trace         INCOMPLETE
participant analytic tail without tail rule    INCOMPLETE
unsupported source class                       INCOMPLETE
source-completeness obligation open             INCOMPLETE
exact strict equality at threshold              FAILED
non-singleton enclosure merely touching bound  INCOMPLETE
implementation fingerprint mismatch            FAILED
```

---

## 10. Theorem-46 approximate seam consumption

Theorem 46 gives an outward quotient radius

\[
\rho_Q
=
\frac{|b|\delta_A+|a|\delta_B}
{|b|(|b|-\delta_B)}
\]

when \(|b|>\delta_B\).

Under Theorem 47, the quantities \(\delta_A\) and \(\delta_B\) become promotion-capable only if they are produced by admitted source-bound remainder validators. Then the approximate seam quotient may consume \(\rho_Q\) through Theorem 45.

Until those remainder sources close, the correct status remains

```text
INCOMPLETE_REMAINDER_VALIDATION
```

rather than a participant-certified quotient.
